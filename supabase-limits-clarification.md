- 2GB bandwidth
- Perfect for: Development, small apps

### Pro Plan ($25/month)
- **UNLIMITED rows** ✅
- 8GB database size
- 100GB file storage
- 50GB bandwidth
- Automatic daily backups
- Perfect for: Your 1,000 users × 500 bookings = 500K rows

### Team Plan ($599/month)
- **UNLIMITED rows** ✅
- UNLIMITED database size
- 1TB file storage
- 500GB bandwidth
- Point-in-time recovery
- Perfect for: 10,000+ users

## What This Means for MusoBuddy

### At 1,000 Users Scale:
- **Total rows**: 500K bookings + 50K other records = 550K rows
- **Database size**: ~1-2GB
- **Monthly cost**: $25 (Pro plan)
- **Per user cost**: $0.025

### At 10,000 Users Scale:
- **Total rows**: 5M bookings + 500K other records = 5.5M rows
- **Database size**: ~10-20GB
- **Monthly cost**: $599 (Team plan) or stay on Pro
- **Per user cost**: $0.06

## Important Notes

1. **No Row Limits on Pro**: Despite some outdated docs, Supabase Pro has NO row limits
2. **Performance at Scale**: 5M rows is nothing for PostgreSQL - with proper indexes, queries stay fast
3. **Real Limit**: Database SIZE (8GB on Pro), not rows
4. **Workaround if Needed**: Archive old data to keep working set small

## Migration Path

### Now (Free Plan):
- Works fine up to ~500 users
- 500K row limit is the constraint

### At 500 Users:
- Upgrade to Pro ($25/month)
- Unlimited rows immediately
- No code changes needed

### At 5,000 Users:
- Still on Pro plan
- ~2.5M rows is fine
- Consider archiving for performance

### At 10,000 Users:
- Consider Team plan for performance
- Or stay on Pro with optimization

## The Bottom Line

**You do NOT need to worry about row limits** - just upgrade to Pro when needed. The real considerations are:
1. Query performance (solved by indexes)
2. Database size (8GB is huge for booking data)
3. Bandwidth (50GB is plenty)

Your architecture will easily handle 10,000+ users on Supabase.
