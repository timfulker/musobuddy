## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Clean white cards with left border status indicators, gradient-styled forms, professional action buttons, responsive layouts (mobile-optimized), consistent sidebar navigation, clear visual cues. Multiple theme options (Purple, Ocean Blue, Forest Green, Clean Pro Audio, Midnight Blue) with theme-aware components and an animated metronome logo.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Core Structure**: Consolidated into `index.ts`, `auth.ts`, `storage.ts`, `services.ts`, `routes.ts`, `database.ts`
- **Authentication**: Branded email/password authentication with PostgreSQL sessions, robust session management, and Replit Auth integration.
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for PDF storage.
- **Email Service**: Mailgun for transactional emails and webhook processing.
- **PDF Generation**: Separate isolated Puppeteer engines for invoices and contracts to prevent cross-system failures.
- **AI Integration**: AI for contract parsing, email parsing, price enquiry detection, and message categorization.
- **System Design Choices**:
    - **User Management**: Replit Auth integration, session-based authentication, user tiers, admin dashboard.
    - **Booking Management**: Unified system, conflict detection, calendar integration (.ics import), status tracking, and manual gig entry. Includes a standalone, token-based booking widget. Booking workflow includes statuses: New, In progress, Client confirms, Confirmed, Completed, Rejected.
    - **Contract Generation**: Dynamic PDF generation, digital signature capabilities, cloud storage, and automated reminders (Phase 2). Guided questionnaire-style contract creation with smart defaults and validation.
    - **Invoice Management**: Professional invoice generation, payment tracking, overdue monitoring, and integration with banking APIs (planned).
    - **Compliance Tracking**: Document management for insurance, licenses, PAT testing; expiry date monitoring and alerts; automated compliance sharing.
    - **Data Flow**: Streamlined authentication, booking lifecycle management, and AI integration for automated data extraction and processing.
    - **Security**: Robust session validation, comprehensive rate limiting, enhanced database connection pooling, and secure password hashing.
    - **Deployment**: Node.js server serving built frontend, environment configuration, build process with Vite and esbuild.
    - **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints, consistent JSON responses, and comprehensive error handling.
    - **System Isolation**: Critical components like invoice and contract generation are designed as entirely separate, isolated systems with their own types, PDF generation, cloud storage, and API endpoints to prevent cross-contamination and cascading failures.
