## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates through Replit Auth
2. Session stored in PostgreSQL sessions table
3. User data synchronized with local users table
4. Frontend receives user object through /api/auth/user endpoint

### Booking Lifecycle
1. New enquiry created (email webhook or manual entry)
2. Conflict detection runs automatically
3. User converts enquiry to booking
4. Contract generated and sent for signature
5. Invoice created upon contract completion
6. Payment tracking and follow-up

### AI Integration
- Email parsing for automatic enquiry extraction
- Conflict resolution suggestions
- Instrument mapping for gig categorization
- Support chat assistance

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Local development with Vite dev server
- Production: Node.js server serving built frontend
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- File Storage: Cloudflare R2 with CDN delivery

### Build Process
1. Frontend built with Vite to `dist/public`
2. Backend compiled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Static assets served from Express server
4. Environment variables for API keys and database connection

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Data cleanup service for old records
- URL maintenance for contract signing links
- Automated reminder system for contracts and invoices
- Conflict resolution system for booking overlaps

The application is designed to be user-friendly while maintaining professional-grade features required for music business management. The architecture supports scalability and maintainability with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and data layers.
