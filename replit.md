4. Frontend receives user object through /api/auth/user endpoint

### Booking Lifecycle
1. New enquiry created (email webhook or manual entry)
2. Conflict detection runs automatically
3. User converts enquiry to booking
4. Contract generated and sent for signature
5. Invoice created upon contract completion
6. Payment tracking and follow-up
