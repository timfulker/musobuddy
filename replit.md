  * **Conservative Implementation**: Maintained all underlying code structure (database, API routes, file names) as "enquiries" for system stability
  * **User Experience Focus**: Changed only user-facing labels while preserving technical infrastructure to avoid breaking changes
  * **Better User Understanding**: Page name now accurately reflects that it handles enquiries, follow-ups, and confirmed bookings
  * **Improved Navigation**: Sidebar now shows "Bookings" to better communicate the page's comprehensive functionality
- July 14, 2025. Comprehensive booking details system with conventional save/cancel functionality implemented:
  * **Detailed Booking Information**: Complete BookingDetailsDialog with 20+ fields including client contact info, event details, venue logistics, timing, and equipment requirements
  * **Professional Form Layout**: Organized into logical sections with card-based design (Basic Info, Client Contact, Event Details, Venue Info, Timing & Setup, Equipment, Custom Fields, Notes)
  * **Custom Fields Support**: Dynamic custom field creation with user-defined titles and content for flexible data capture
  * **Conventional Save/Cancel Pattern**: Professional form controls with Save Changes (green) and Cancel buttons at bottom instead of auto-save
  * **Intuitive Button Labels**: "Switch to Edit Mode" / "Switch to View Mode" clearly indicate actions rather than current state
  * **Enhanced Close Functionality**: Close button appears in view mode only, preventing accidental data loss during editing
  * **X Button Removal**: Eliminated confusing default dialog X button to avoid save/cancel ambiguity
  * **Edit Mode Protection**: Dialog prevents accidental closing during edit mode - users must save or cancel changes
  * **Auto-Save Prevention**: Form reset on cancel restores original values, save button required for data persistence
  * **Form Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation with email validation and proper error messaging
  * **Status**: Complete booking details management system operational with professional UX patterns
- July 14, 2025. Email sending system restored and deployment requirement confirmed:
  * **Root Cause Fixed**: Email sending was disabled with hardcoded `emailSent = false` in both invoice and contract routes
  * **Mailgun Integration Enabled**: Restored actual `sendEmail(emailData)` function calls for both invoice and contract email sending
  * **Authentication Issue Identified**: Development environment shows "Unauthorized" error - Mailgun configured for production deployment
  * **Deployment Requirement**: Email sending (both outgoing and incoming) requires deployment to production environment
  * **Production Email Infrastructure**: Mailgun domain authentication and API keys configured for deployed app URL
  * **Status**: Email sending code fixed but requires deployment for functional email delivery
  * **Next Step**: Deploy to production to test complete email workflow (invoice sending and contract signing)
- July 14, 2025. Mailgun credentials updated and enhanced debugging implemented:
  * **Mailgun API Key Updated**: Configured with production API key `c5ea400f-c4441c1f` from Mailgun dashboard
  * **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track email sending process and environment variables
  * **Environment Variable Validation**: System now validates MAILGUN_API_KEY and MAILGUN_DOMAIN availability
  * **Domain Configuration**: Confirmed mg.musobuddy.com domain setup with proper webhook signing keys
  * **Deployment in Progress**: Redeploying with updated credentials to enable production email functionality
  * **Status**: Email system configured and ready for production testing after deployment completes
  * **Status**: Page naming updated throughout interface for clearer user experience

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Implementation approach: When asked for insight/opinion on issues, provide perspective and recommendations WITHOUT automatically implementing changes. Only implement when explicitly requested to do so.
