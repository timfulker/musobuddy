- **Professional Client Experience**: ✅ Clients see proper already-signed page instead of active signing form after contract completion

### Known System Quirks (Not to be Fixed)
- **Email Link Behavior**: Contract signing email links remain active after signing and still show signing form initially. If client clicks sign again, they receive "already signed" message. This is acceptable behavior as clients rarely re-visit signing links after completion. Previous fix attempts caused more problems than benefits, so this quirk is documented but not addressed.
- **Development Dashboard Logout**: In development environment only, clicking the Dashboard menu item occasionally logs users out due to authentication state timing issues. This does NOT occur in production environment where dashboard navigation works correctly. Development-only quirk - production authentication is stable.

- **Email Links Preserved**: ✅ Confirmation emails continue using direct R2 URLs for optimal client experience
- **Invoice CORS Fix Applied**: ✅ Applied same CORS fix to invoice downloads - authenticated route serves directly, public route redirects to R2
- **Public Routes Added**: ✅ Added /download/invoices/:id and /download/contracts/:id for email confirmation links
- **Future Enhancement Noted**: ✅ User suggestion to open contract PDFs in new tabs for better UX (deferred until more testing)
- **Root Cause**: ✅ R2-hosted signing pages making API calls to app server require explicit CORS allowance; R2 PDFs need app server proxy for browser downloads
