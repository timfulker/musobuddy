Email Subject: "${processedSubject}"
Email Body: "${processedBody}"

CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Today's date: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
- Current year: ${currentYear}
- Current month: ${currentDate.getMonth() + 1}
- Current day: ${currentDate.getDate()}

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Find the ACTUAL EVENT DATE - look for "Sunday 24 Aug 2025", "Aug 24", "24 Aug 2025" etc. NOT email send dates like "13 Jul 2025 at 15:42"
- RELATIVE DATE PARSING: For relative dates like "next Saturday", "next Friday", calculate from today's date (${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}) within the current year (${currentYear}) unless explicitly stated otherwise. For "next February" or "next [month]", if the month has already passed this year, use the next year (e.g., "next February" in July 2025 means February 2026).
- Find the ACTUAL VENUE - look for location names like "Bognor Regis", "Brighton", city names, NOT email addresses or timestamps
- Find BUDGET/PRICE information - look for "¬£260-¬£450", "¬£300", price ranges in the email content

Extract:
- eventDate: The actual event/performance date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "Sunday 24 Aug 2025" = "2025-08-24", "14th July 2026" = "2026-07-14")
- eventTime: Start time if mentioned (e.g., "1:00pm - 3:00pm", "7:30pm")
- venue: Location/venue name including city/area (e.g., "Bognor Regis", "Brighton Hotel", "London venue")
- eventType: wedding, birthday, corporate, party, celebration, private event, etc.
- gigType: sax, saxophone, jazz, piano, guitar, dj, band, violin, drums, etc.
- clientPhone: UK phone number if mentioned
- estimatedValue: Budget/price range if mentioned (e.g., "¬£260-¬£450", "¬£300", "budget of ¬£500")
- applyNowLink: Return null if not an Encore email

Return valid JSON only:`;
