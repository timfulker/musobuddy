Hi Ronan,

Thank you for your assistance with our SendGrid inbound email issue. 

Since we haven't heard back and our business needs reliable email forwarding, we're temporarily switching to an alternative solution to keep operations running.

If you do find a resolution to the SendGrid inbound parse routing issue, please let us know - we'd be happy to switch back once it's working properly.

The technical details remain the same:
- Domain: musobuddy.com  
- Webhook: https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/sendgrid
- All DNS records correctly configured

Thanks again for your time investigating this.

Best regards,
Tim
