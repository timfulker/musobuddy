**Subject:** UPDATE: Webhook Issue Resolved - MusoBuddy Email Forwarding Now Working

**To:** Ronan N. (SendGrid Support)

Hi Ronan,

Thank you for your assistance with our email forwarding issue for leads@musobuddy.com. I wanted to provide you with an update on our investigation and resolution.

## Issue Resolution Summary

We've successfully identified and resolved the webhook delivery problem. Here's what we discovered:

### Root Cause Identified
The issue was **not** with SendGrid's Inbound Parse service. Using webhook.site as a test endpoint, we confirmed that:
- âœ… SendGrid is correctly receiving emails sent to leads@musobuddy.com
- âœ… SendGrid is successfully sending POST requests to webhook endpoints
- âœ… All email data is being parsed and transmitted properly

### The Real Problem
The issue was on our application server (Replit) - specifically with **middleware ordering** in our Express.js application. Our webhook route was being registered after other middleware that was interfering with the request processing.

### Technical Fix Applied
We moved the webhook route registration to the highest priority level in our application:
```javascript
// Priority webhook route - registered before all other middleware
app.post('/api/webhook/sendgrid', async (req, res) => {
  // Handle SendGrid webhook immediately
});
```

## Current Status
- ðŸŸ¢ **Email forwarding is now operational**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Webhook endpoint responding correctly**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Enquiries being created from forwarded emails**

## Verification Steps Completed
1. **webhook.site test** - Confirmed SendGrid is sending requests
2. **Direct webhook test** - Confirmed our endpoint is now accessible
3. **End-to-end test** - Sent test emails that successfully created enquiries

## Next Steps
We're updating our SendGrid Inbound Parse configuration to point back to our production webhook URL:
`https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/sendgrid`

## Appreciation
Thank you for your thorough investigation and patience. Your suggestion to test with webhook.site was the key breakthrough that helped us identify the true source of the problem.

The issue was entirely on our application side, not with SendGrid's service, which has been working flawlessly throughout.

Best regards,
Tim Fulker
