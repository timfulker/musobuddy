# Cloudflare Dashboard Display Issue

## Problem
- R2 bucket `musobuddy-documents` exists and works (files upload successfully)
- Bucket is NOT showing in Cloudflare dashboard (shows "You haven't created a bucket yet")
- System was working last week with same credentials and bucket

## Possible Causes
1. **Dashboard Cache Issue**: Cloudflare dashboard not refreshing properly
2. **Account Switching**: Multiple Cloudflare accounts, viewing wrong one
3. **Regional Settings**: Bucket created in different region than dashboard is showing
4. **Permission Issue**: API keys have access but dashboard user doesn't
5. **Recent Changes**: Cloudflare updated their interface and bucket isn't migrated

## Evidence Bucket Exists
- ✅ File uploads work perfectly
- ✅ ListObjects API returns files
- ✅ Bucket operations succeed
- ❌ Dashboard shows 0 buckets

## Solutions to Try
1. **Hard refresh dashboard**: Ctrl+F5 or clear Cloudflare cookies
2. **Check account**: Ensure you're in the same Cloudflare account as last week
3. **Use different browser**: Try incognito/private mode
4. **Contact Cloudflare**: They can see bucket from their side
5. **Manual URL**: Try going directly to bucket settings URL

## Workaround
If dashboard issue persists, we can serve contracts directly through app server instead of R2 public URLs as temporary solution.

## Status
Bucket exists and works - this is purely a dashboard visibility issue.
