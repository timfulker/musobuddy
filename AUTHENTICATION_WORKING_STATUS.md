# Authentication System - Working Status
*Last Updated: September 19, 2025*

## âœ… CURRENT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Working Features
- **User Registration**: New users can sign up successfully in both environments
- **User Login**: Existing users can authenticate without issues
- **Data Persistence**: All user data saves correctly to database
- **Environment Support**: Both development and production fully functional

### System Configuration

#### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5001
- **Database**: Supabase Development Instance
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

#### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: Production domain
- **Backend**: Production API endpoint
- **Database**: Supabase Production Instance
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Key Implementation Details

#### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/logs in via Supabase Auth
2. JWT token issued by Supabase
3. Backend validates token via Supabase Admin SDK
4. User record created/updated in public.users table
5. Session maintained across requests

#### Database Structure
- **auth.users**: Supabase Auth managed user records
- **public.users**: Application user data linked via supabase_uid
- Automatic sync between auth and public schemas

### Testing Accounts
- Development: Test accounts created and verified
- Production: Live user accounts operational

### Files Involved
- `/server/middleware/supabase-only-auth.ts` - Main auth middleware
- `/client/src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.tsx` - Frontend auth hook
- `/server/core/supabase-admin.ts` - Backend Supabase admin client
- `/client/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Frontend Supabase client

### Recent Fixes Applied
- Corrected user linkage between auth.users and public.users
- Fixed port configuration (Backend: 5001, Frontend: 5173)
- Resolved 404 errors on API endpoints
- Established proper JWT validation

## No Known Issues
The authentication system is currently working as expected with no blocking issues.

## Maintenance Notes
- Regular monitoring of Supabase Auth logs recommended
- Keep Supabase SDK versions in sync
- Monitor rate limits on authentication endpoints
