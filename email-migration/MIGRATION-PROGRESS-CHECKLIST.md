## üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- üîÑ Production deployment completing

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO - Phase 3: Testing**

**After deployment completes:**

### 1. Test SendGrid Sending (5-10 min)
- [ ] Temporarily change `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid` in production Replit Secrets
- [ ] Trigger a test email (password reset, contract, or any app email)
- [ ] Check logs to verify it sends via SendGrid
- [ ] Verify email delivers to recipient
- [ ] Switch back to `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailgun`

### 2. Test Webhook Endpoints (10-15 min)
**Note:** Webhooks won't receive real emails until MX records changed
- [ ] Option A: Manually trigger webhook with curl/Postman to test endpoint
- [ ] Option B: Use SendGrid webhook test tool (if available)
- [ ] Check production logs for `üü¢ [sendgrid_enq_*]` entries
- [ ] Verify webhook handles SendGrid format correctly

### 3. Test Personal Forwarding (5 min)
- [ ] Verify at least 1 user has `personalForwardEmail` set in settings
- [ ] After MX change: Send test email to that user's prefix@enquiries.musobuddy.com
- [ ] Confirm email forwards to personal address
- [ ] Verify email also appears in app

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO - Phase 4: Production Switch**

**Only after Phase 3 tests pass:**

### 1. Update DNS MX Records in Namecheap (5 min)
- [ ] Go to Namecheap ‚Üí Domain List ‚Üí musobuddy.com ‚Üí Advanced DNS
- [ ] Add MX record: `enquiries.musobuddy.com` ‚Üí `mx.sendgrid.net` (priority 10)
- [ ] Add MX record: `mg.musobuddy.com` ‚Üí `mx.sendgrid.net` (priority 10)
- [ ] Wait 1-4 hours for DNS propagation
- [ ] Verify with: `dig MX enquiries.musobuddy.com`

### 2. Switch EMAIL_PROVIDER (30 seconds)
- [ ] Go to Replit ‚Üí Secrets
- [ ] Change `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`
- [ ] Restart production deployment if needed
- [ ] Verify restart successful

### 3. Monitor Production (24-48 hours)
- [ ] Watch logs for SendGrid webhook activity (`üü¢ [sendgrid_enq_*]` and `üîµ [sendgrid_rep_*]`)
- [ ] Verify emails sending correctly
- [ ] Verify emails receiving correctly
- [ ] Test personal forwarding with real emails
- [ ] Monitor for any errors or issues
- [ ] Check deliverability (no bounces)

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO - Phase 5: Cleanup (30-90 days later)**

**Only after 30+ days of stable SendGrid operation:**

### 1. Monitor Stability (30 days)
- [ ] Track email deliverability
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Confirm no Mailgun dependency issues
- [ ] Verify all 24 users' personal forwarding working

### 2. Remove Mailgun Routes (5 min)
- [ ] Go to Mailgun dashboard
- [ ] Delete 24 user-specific routes (priority 1)
- [ ] Delete 2 catch-all routes (priority 0 and 1)
- [ ] Verify no routes remain

### 3. Clean Up Code (10 min)
- [ ] Remove `EmailService_OLD` class from `server/core/services.ts`
- [ ] Remove Mailgun imports if no longer needed
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect SendGrid as primary provider

### 4. Remove Mailgun Account (2 min)
- [ ] Remove `MAILGUN_API_KEY` from Replit Secrets
- [ ] Remove `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` from Replit Secrets
- [ ] Cancel Mailgun subscription
- [ ] Save final invoice for records

## üîí **SAFETY NOTES**

### Current State:
- ‚úÖ `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailgun` (still active - no production impact yet)
- ‚úÖ MX records still point to Mailgun (no emails routing to SendGrid yet)
- ‚úÖ New webhooks deployed but inactive (waiting for MX record change)
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback available

### Rollback Procedure (if needed):
1. **Emergency rollback (30 seconds):**
   - Change `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailgun` in Replit Secrets
   - Restart production deployment

2. **Full rollback (1-4 hours):**
   - Update MX records back to Mailgun
   - Wait for DNS propagation
   - Change `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailgun`

3. **When to rollback:**
   - Emails not sending via SendGrid
   - Webhooks failing
   - Personal forwarding broken
   - Deliverability issues

---

## üìä **Success Metrics**

Migration is successful when:
- ‚úÖ All outbound emails sending via SendGrid
- ‚úÖ All inbound emails routing to correct webhooks
- ‚úÖ Personal email forwarding working for all 24 users
- ‚úÖ No user complaints about email issues
- ‚úÖ Deliverability rate > 99%
- ‚úÖ 30 days of stable operation
- ‚úÖ Cost savings realized ($60-90/month ‚Üí $19.95/month)

3. Verify logs show SendGrid activity
4. Switch back to Mailgun
5. Plan MX record change timing
