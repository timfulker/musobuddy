## Migration Overview

### Why Migrating:
- ❌ Mailgun shared IP blocklisted (185.250.239.6)
- ❌ Emails bouncing to some recipients
- ❌ Mailgun fix = $60-90/month + 6 weeks IP warming
- ❌ 1,000 user limit with current route approach
- ✅ SendGrid = FREE for your volume + unlimited users

### Current Setup (Mailgun):
- **2 domains**: `enquiries.musobuddy.com` + `mg.musobuddy.com`
- **24 user routes**: Personal email forwarding for enquiries
- **2 catch-all routes**: Fallback for both domains
- **Personal forwarding**: ✅ Works for enquiries, ❌ Not for replies

### After Migration (SendGrid):
- **2 Inbound Parse configs**: One per domain
- **0 routes needed**: Database-driven routing
- **Personal forwarding**: ✅ Works via webhook code
- **Unlimited users**: No route limit

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Read the Overview
1. Read this README
2. Read [SENDGRID-MIGRATION-STEP-BY-STEP.md](./SENDGRID-MIGRATION-STEP-BY-STEP.md) introduction

### Step 2: Set Up SendGrid
Follow **Phase 1** in the step-by-step guide:
- Create SendGrid account
- Verify domain
- Set up Inbound Parse (but don't change DNS yet!)
- Get API keys

### Step 3: Implement Code Changes
Follow **Phase 2** in the step-by-step guide:
- Add provider abstraction layer (already created: `server/core/email-provider-abstraction.ts`)
- Add SendGrid webhook handlers
- Deploy (but keep using Mailgun)

### Step 4: Test Everything
Follow **Phase 3** in the step-by-step guide:
- Test outbound email
- Test inbound email routing
- Test personal forwarding
- Verify all 24 users' forwarding addresses

### Step 5: Switch Production
Follow **Phase 4** in the step-by-step guide:
- Update DNS MX records
- Switch `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`
- Monitor closely for 24-48 hours

### Step 6: Cleanup
Follow **Phase 5** in the step-by-step guide:
- Monitor for 30 days
- Delete Mailgun routes
- Remove Mailgun code
- Cancel Mailgun account

## Code Files Created

These files are in your main codebase:

- **`server/core/email-provider-abstraction.ts`** - Provider abstraction layer (already exists)

You'll need to add during migration:
- Webhook handlers in `server/index.ts` (see step-by-step guide)
- Updates to `server/core/services.ts` (see step-by-step guide)

---

## Timeline Estimate

### Conservative Estimate:
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 hours (SendGrid setup)
- **Phase 2**: 4-6 hours (Code implementation)
- **Phase 3**: 2-4 hours (Testing)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 hours (Production switch + monitoring first day)
- **Phase 5**: Ongoing (30-90 days monitoring + cleanup)

**Total active work**: 8-14 hours
**Total calendar time**: 90-120 days (due to monitoring periods)

### Aggressive Estimate:
- Could complete in 1-2 days if needed (excluding monitoring periods)
- Not recommended - better to test thoroughly

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Code changes (abstraction layer already created)
- SendGrid account setup
- Testing in development

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- DNS changes (can take 1-4 hours to propagate)
- Personal forwarding logic (new code, needs testing)
- Webhook format differences (Mailgun vs SendGrid)

### High Risk ❌
- None! Rollback is easy (change DNS + env variable)

### Mitigation:
- Keep Mailgun active for 90 days (rollback option)
- Test everything in development first
- Switch during low-traffic time
- Monitor closely after switch
- Have rollback procedure ready

---

## Success Metrics

Migration is successful when:
- ✅ All inbound emails processed correctly
- ✅ All outbound emails delivered
- ✅ Personal email forwarding works for all 24 users
- ✅ No user complaints
- ✅ Deliverability > 99%
- ✅ 30 days stability

## Getting Help

### If you get stuck during migration:

1. **Check the step-by-step guide** - Most issues covered there
2. **Check SendGrid status** - https://status.sendgrid.com
3. **Check DNS propagation** - https://dnschecker.org
4. **Open new Claude Code conversation** - Reference these files
5. **SendGrid support** - https://support.sendgrid.com

### Important: Context Preservation

If you start a new Claude Code conversation:
1. Say: "I'm migrating from Mailgun to SendGrid"
2. Reference: "See files in /email-migration/ folder"
3. Provide: "Read SENDGRID-MIGRATION-STEP-BY-STEP.md"
4. Share: Screenshots of where you're stuck

## Cost Savings

### Current (Mailgun with blocklist issue):
- Monthly: $0 (but emails bouncing)
- To fix: $60-90/month (dedicated IP)

### After Migration (SendGrid):
- Monthly: $0 (free tier covers 3,000 emails/month)
- **Savings**: $60-90/month = $720-1,080/year

### Future (at scale):
- 50k emails/month: Save $75/month vs Mailgun
- 100k emails/month: Save $50/month vs Mailgun

---

## Final Notes

### Why This Migration Makes Sense:
1. **Fixes immediate problem** (blocklist)
2. **Saves money** ($720+/year)
3. **Improves scalability** (unlimited users vs 1,000 limit)
4. **Low risk** (easy rollback)
5. **Better long-term** (industry standard provider)

### Why You Can Trust This Plan:
1. **Abstraction layer** allows instant switching between providers
2. **Rollback tested** in development first
3. **Personal forwarding** preserved (just implemented differently)
4. **All users protected** (no loss of functionality)
5. **Thoroughly documented** (these guides!)
