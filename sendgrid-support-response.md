## Latest Support Response
> "Thank you for your detailed response and for confirming the configurations. I understand how challenging this situation can be, and I'm here to assist you in resolving it.
> 
> Here are the next steps we can take:
> 
> **Verify Email Reception**: I will check if any email attempts to leads@musobuddy.com or test@leads.musobuddy.com were received or dropped by our inbound system.
> 
> **Check Subdomain Routing**: I will also verify if leads.musobuddy.com is correctly routed on our side for parse handling.
> 
> **Review Configurations**: Please ensure that the MX record for your subdomain is set to mx.sendgrid.net with a priority of 10, and that the subdomain is unique and not used for other purposes."
