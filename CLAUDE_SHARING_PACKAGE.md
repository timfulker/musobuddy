# MusoBuddy - Code Sharing Package for Claude

## Current Issue
Contract signing works in Replit preview but fails in deployed environment. Emails not being sent after contract signing in production.

## Key Files Changed

### 1. server/routes.ts (Lines 640-820)
**Contract Signing Route with PDF Fallback**
- Added PDF generation error handling
- Implemented email delivery with/without PDF attachments
- Enhanced logging for deployment troubleshooting

### 2. Recent Changes Summary
- Fixed PDF generation fallback for deployment compatibility
- Added conditional email attachments based on PDF generation success
- Enhanced error handling throughout email processing pipeline
- Implemented graceful degradation for PDF failures

## Testing Status
- Contract #79 (CON-2025-DEPLOY) created for testing
- Preview environment: All functionality working
- Deployed environment: Contract signing confirmation works, emails fail

## Architecture Notes
- Using SendGrid for email delivery
- Puppeteer for PDF generation (fails in deployment)
- setTimeout() approach for background processing
- Public contract signing routes (no auth required)

## Expected Behavior
1. Contract signing responds immediately (< 200ms)
2. Background email processing begins
3. Both client and performer receive confirmation emails
4. PDFs attached if generation succeeds, graceful fallback if not

## Deployment Environment Issues
- PDF generation (Puppeteer) fails in deployed environment
- Email processing should continue despite PDF failures
- Need cross-browser compatibility (iOS works, Mac OS Chrome fails)

## Next Steps
Test contract #79 at deployed URL: /sign-contract/79
Monitor logs for: "DEPLOYMENT EMAIL PROCESSING COMPLETED"
