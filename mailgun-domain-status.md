# Mailgun Domain Status - mg.musobuddy.com

## Current Status (as of verification)

✅ **SPF Record**: Verified  
✅ **MX Records**: Both verified (mxa.eu.mailgun.org and mxb.eu.mailgun.org)  
✅ **CNAME Record**: Verified (email.mg.musobuddy.com)  
⚠️ **DKIM Record**: Active (waiting for full verification)  
⚠️ **DMARC Record**: Unconfigured  

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for DKIM Verification
The DKIM record shows as "Active" but needs full verification. This usually takes a few more minutes.

### 2. DMARC Record (Optional)
The DMARC record is showing as "Unconfigured" but this is optional and won't prevent email functionality.

### 3. Create Email Route
Once DKIM shows as "Verified", create the email route:
- Go to **Receiving** → **Routes**
- Click **Create Route**
- **Filter**: `match_recipient("leads@musobuddy.com")`
- **Forward to**: `https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/mailgun`

### 4. Test Email System
- Send test email to leads@musobuddy.com
- Verify enquiry creation in dashboard
- Test outgoing emails (invoices/contracts)

## Domain Status
The domain is essentially ready for use. The core records (SPF, MX, CNAME) are verified, which enables both sending and receiving emails.

## Expected Timeline
- DKIM verification: 5-15 minutes
- Route creation: Immediate
- Email testing: Immediate after route creation
