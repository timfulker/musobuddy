**Integration:** SendGrid & Mailgun dual-provider routing with automatic failover
**Webhooks:** Configured and operational for both providers

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**File:** `shared/schema.ts:841-871`

Created `emailDeliveryFailures` table with comprehensive tracking:
- User and booking associations
- Email type classification (contract, invoice, response, etc.)
- Failure type tracking (hard_bounce, soft_bounce, spam_complaint, blocked, invalid)
- Retry mechanism (retryCount, lastRetryAt)
- Resolution tracking (resolved, resolvedAt, actionTaken)
- Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- User notification status (notifiedUser, notifiedAt)
- Provider tracking (sendgrid, mailgun)

**Indexes for performance:**
- `idx_email_failures_user` - Fast user lookups
- `idx_email_failures_booking` - Booking associations
- `idx_email_failures_resolved` - Filtering resolved vs unresolved
- `idx_email_failures_type` - Email type filtering
- `idx_email_failures_created` - Time-based queries

### 2. Storage Methods ✅
**Files:**
- `server/storage/misc-storage.ts:773-1071`
- `server/core/storage.ts:810-866`

**User-Facing Methods:**
- `createEmailDeliveryFailure()` - Track new failures
- `getUnresolvedEmailFailures(userId)` - Get user's failed emails
- `getUnresolvedEmailFailuresCount(userId)` - Count for notification badge
- `markEmailFailureAsResolved(id, actionTaken)` - User resolves failure
- `getEmailFailureById(id)` - Get specific failure details

**Admin Analytics Methods:**
- `getAllEmailFailures(filters)` - Filtered failure list
- `getEmailFailureAnalytics(days)` - Grouped analytics by provider/type
- `incrementEmailFailureRetry(id)` - Track retry attempts
- `markEmailFailureAsNotified(id)` - Track notification delivery

**Suppression Methods (Placeholder):**
- `addSuppressedEmail()` - Add to suppression list
- `getSuppressedEmail()` - Check suppression status
- `removeSuppressedEmail()` - Remove from suppression
- `getAllSuppressedEmails()` - List all suppressed emails

> **Note:** Suppression methods are currently placeholders. Full implementation requires creating a `suppressed_emails` table per `BOUNCE-HANDLING-IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

### 3. Bounce Handler Integration ✅
**File:** `server/core/bounce-handler.ts:157-213`

**New Functionality:**
- `createEmailFailureNotifications()` - Creates user notifications for bounces
- Integrated into hard bounce handler (line 74)
- Integrated into soft bounce handler (line 113)
- Integrated into spam complaint handler (line 148)

**Process Flow:**
1. Webhook receives bounce from SendGrid/Mailgun
2. Bounce handler processes bounce type
3. Creates email delivery failure record for affected users
4. Associates with relevant bookings
5. Sets priority based on email type (contracts/invoices = high)

### 4. User Notification API ✅
**File:** `server/routes/notification-routes.ts`

**Updated Endpoints:**

**GET /api/notifications/counts** (Updated: lines 37-81)
- Added `failedEmails` count to notification counts
- Included in total notification count
- Safe database call with development fallbacks

**GET /api/notifications/failed-emails** (New: lines 190-225)
- Returns unresolved email failures for logged-in user
- Joins with booking data for context
- Includes client name, event date, venue
- Logs samples for debugging

**POST /api/notifications/failed-emails/:id/resolve** (New: lines 227-261)
- Marks failure as resolved
- Accepts optional `actionTaken` note
- User ownership verification
- Returns updated failure record

### 5. Email Sending Integration ✅
**File:** `server/core/email-provider-abstraction.ts`

**Pre-Send Checks (lines 300-316):**
- Checks suppression list before sending
- Blocks suppressed emails from being sent
- Logs suppression reason
- Fails open if suppression check errors

**Failure Tracking (lines 334-422):**
- Automatically tracks send failures
- Extracts userId and bookingId from replyTo field
- Falls back to booking search if replyTo unavailable
- Determines email type from subject line
- Sets priority (high for contracts/invoices)
- Non-blocking async tracking (doesn't fail email send)

### 6. Smart Routing with Failover ✅
**File:** `server/core/email-provider-abstraction.ts:318-382`

**Automatic Failover Logic:**
1. **Primary Provider Selection:**
   - Yahoo/AOL → Mailgun
   - Microsoft (Hotmail/Outlook/Live) → Mailgun
   - Other domains → Default provider (SendGrid)

2. **Unconfigured Provider Failover:**
   - If primary provider not configured, tries alternate
   - Logs failover action
   - Tracks final failure if both unavailable

3. **Send Failure Failover:**
   - If primary send fails, automatically tries alternate provider
   - Only tracks failure if both providers fail
   - Logs success when failover works
   - Example: SendGrid fails → tries Mailgun → success

**Benefits:**
- Maximum delivery rate
- Automatic provider redundancy
- No manual intervention needed
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 7. Admin Analytics Dashboard ✅
**File:** `server/routes/admin-routes.ts:2126-2267`

**New Admin Endpoints:**

**GET /api/admin/email-delivery-analytics** (lines 2128-2179)
- Analytics grouped by provider and failure type
- Customizable time period (default: 30 days)
- Total failure counts
- Breakdown by provider (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Breakdown by type (hard_bounce, soft_bounce, etc.)
- Total retry attempts per provider

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "analytics": {
    "totalFailures": 45,
    "byProvider": {
      "sendgrid": {
        "totalFailures": 28,
        "byType": {
          "hard_bounce": 15,
          "soft_bounce": 10,
          "spam_complaint": 3
        },
        "totalRetries": 12
      },
      "mailgun": {
        "totalFailures": 17,
        "byType": {
          "hard_bounce": 8,
          "blocked": 9
        },
        "totalRetries": 5
      }
    },
    "period": "Last 30 days"
  }
}
```

**GET /api/admin/email-delivery-failures** (lines 2181-2213)
- Filtered list of all email failures
- Optional filters: provider, failureType, limit
- Returns full failure details
- Useful for investigating specific issues

**GET /api/admin/email-provider-status** (lines 2215-2267)
- Real-time provider configuration status
- Recent failure rates (last 24 hours)
- Default provider indication
- Health monitoring endpoint

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "providers": {
    "sendgrid": {
      "configured": true,
      "recentFailures": 3
    },
    "mailgun": {
      "configured": true,
      "recentFailures": 1
    },
    "default": "sendgrid"
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalRecentFailures": 4,
    "period": "Last 24 hours"
  }
}
```

### 8. Bounce Webhook Endpoints ✅
**File:** `server/index.ts:2199-2306`

**New Webhook Routes:**

**POST /api/webhook/sendgrid/bounce** (lines 2203-2253)
- Receives bounce, dropped, spam, and deferred events from SendGrid
- Processes single or batch events
- Integrates with `parseSendGridBounce()` and `bounceHandler`
- Comprehensive logging with unique webhook IDs
- Returns 200 status to prevent retries

**POST /api/webhook/mailgun/bounce** (lines 2256-2306)
- Receives failed and complained events from Mailgun
- Processes Mailgun event format
- Integrates with `parseMailgunBounce()` and `bounceHandler`
- Comprehensive logging with unique webhook IDs
- Returns 200 status to prevent retries

**Configuration Status:**
- ✅ SendGrid webhooks configured for all events
- ✅ Mailgun webhooks configured for all domains
- ✅ Both providers sending events to production endpoints

### 9. Deferred Email Tracking ✅
**File:** `server/core/bounce-handler.ts:23-243`

**New Functionality:**

**Deferred Tracking System:**
- In-memory tracking of deferred emails
- Tracks first/last deferred timestamps
- Counts deferral events per email
- 24-hour notification threshold

**Key Methods:**
- `handleDeferred()` - Track deferred emails without immediate notification (lines 175-198)
- `checkStuckDeferrals()` - Find emails deferred 24+ hours and notify users (lines 204-243)
- `clearDeferredTracking()` - Remove from tracking when resolved (lines 248-253)

**Scheduled Job:**
**File:** `server/index.ts:2592-2613`
- Runs on server startup
- Checks every hour for stuck deferrals
- Non-blocking error handling
- Creates user notifications for emails deferred 24+ hours

**How It Works:**
```
Deferred Event Received
       ↓
Track in memory (don't notify yet)
       ↓
Hourly job checks: Been 24+ hours?
       ↓ YES
Create user notification
       ↓
Remove from tracking
```

**Provider Support:**
- ✅ SendGrid: `event: 'deferred'`
- ❌ Mailgun: No separate deferred event (handles internally)

## Email Type Classification

The system automatically determines email type based on subject line:

| Subject Contains | Classified As | Priority |
|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| "contract", "agreement" | contract | high |
| "invoice", "payment" | invoice | high |
| "enquiry", "booking" | response | medium |
| Other | other | medium |

---

## Failure Type Definitions

| Type | Description | User Impact |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **hard_bounce** | Permanent failure - email address doesn't exist | Critical - email will never reach client |
| **soft_bounce** | Temporary failure - mailbox full, server down | High - may reach client later |
| **spam_complaint** | Recipient marked as spam | Critical - reputation damage |
| **deferred** | Email delayed 24+ hours - provider still retrying | Medium - email may eventually deliver |
| **blocked** | Send failure - configuration or provider issue | High - needs immediate attention |
| **invalid** | Invalid email format | Critical - need to update email address |

---

## Priority Levels

| Priority | When Used | Notification Urgency |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **critical** | Hard bounces, spam complaints for contracts/invoices | Immediate action required |
| **high** | Contracts, invoices, blocked sends | Action required soon |
| **medium** | General responses, other email types | Review when convenient |
| **low** | Follow-ups, reminders | Low urgency |

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

To test the system without real bounces:

```typescript
// In server console or test script
import { storage } from './server/core/storage';

// Create a test failure
await storage.createEmailDeliveryFailure({
  userId: 'your-user-id',
  bookingId: 123,
  recipientEmail: 'test@example.com',
  recipientName: 'Test Client',
  emailType: 'contract',
  subject: 'Test Contract Email',
  failureType: 'hard_bounce',
  failureReason: 'Test: Mailbox does not exist',
  provider: 'sendgrid',
  priority: 'high'
});

// Check if it shows up in notifications
const failures = await storage.getUnresolvedEmailFailures('your-user-id');
console.log('Failed emails:', failures);

// Check the count
const count = await storage.getUnresolvedEmailFailuresCount('your-user-id');
console.log('Failed email count:', count);
```

### Webhook Testing

Use webhook testing tools to simulate bounce events:

**For SendGrid:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/sendgrid/bounce \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "event": "bounce",
    "type": "hard",
    "reason": "550 5.1.1 User unknown",
    "timestamp": 1697198400
  }]'
```

**For Mailgun:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/mailgun/bounce \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event-data": {
      "event": "failed",
      "severity": "permanent",
      "recipient": "test@example.com",
      "delivery-status": {
        "message": "550 5.1.1 User unknown"
      },
      "timestamp": 1697198400
    }
  }'
```

---

## Optional Enhancements

### 1. Create Suppressed Emails Table (Optional Enhancement)

The bounce handler currently logs suppression but doesn't persist it to database. To add persistent suppression tracking, create the table:

**Add to `shared/schema.ts`:**
```typescript
export const suppressedEmails = pgTable("suppressed_emails", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  email: varchar("email", { length: 255 }).unique().notNull(),
  reason: varchar("reason", { length: 50 }).notNull(),
  firstBounceDate: timestamp("first_bounce_date").notNull().defaultNow(),
  bounceCount: integer("bounce_count").notNull().default(1),
  provider: varchar("provider", { length: 20 }),
  notes: text("notes"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").notNull().defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").notNull().defaultNow(),
}, (table) => [
  index("idx_suppressed_emails_email").on(table.email),
  index("idx_suppressed_emails_reason").on(table.reason),
]);
```

**Update `server/storage/misc-storage.ts`:**
- Replace placeholder methods with actual database operations
- Import `suppressedEmails` from schema
- Implement CRUD operations

### 2. Create User-Facing UI (Optional Enhancement)

**Frontend Components Needed:**
- Failed emails notification badge in navigation
- Failed emails page (similar to Messages page)
- Email failure detail modal
- Resolve failure dialog with action notes
- Retry email button (future enhancement)

**Example React Component:**
```typescript
// FailedEmailsPage.tsx
import { useFailedEmails } from '../hooks/useFailedEmails';

export function FailedEmailsPage() {
  const { failures, loading, resolveFailure } = useFailedEmails();

  return (
    <div className="failed-emails-page">
      <h1>Failed Email Deliveries</h1>
      {failures.map(failure => (
        <FailedEmailCard
          key={failure.id}
          failure={failure}
          onResolve={resolveFailure}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Add Email Retry Mechanism (Optional Enhancement)

Create a scheduled job to retry soft failures:

**Create `server/jobs/email-retry-job.ts`:**
```typescript
import { storage } from '../core/storage';
import { emailService } from '../core/email-provider-abstraction';

export async function retryFailedEmails() {
  // Get unresolved soft_bounce failures with retryCount < 3
  const failures = await storage.getAllEmailFailures({
    failureType: 'soft_bounce',
    // Add filter for unresolved and retryCount < 3
  });

  for (const failure of failures) {
    // Re-send email
    // If successful, mark as resolved
    // If failed, increment retry count
  }
}

// Schedule to run every 4 hours
setInterval(retryFailedEmails, 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### 4. Create Admin Dashboard UI (Optional Enhancement)

**Admin Analytics Page:**
- Provider status indicators
- Failure rate charts (by provider, by type)
- Recent failures table with filters
- Export to CSV functionality
- Email pattern analysis (which domains bouncing most)

### 5. Add User Email Notifications (Optional Enhancement)

Send email to users when their client emails fail:

**Create `server/core/email-failure-notifier.ts`:**
```typescript
import { emailService } from './email-provider-abstraction';

export async function notifyUserOfEmailFailure(userId: string, failure: any) {
  const user = await storage.getUserById(userId);

  await emailService.sendEmail({
    to: user.email,
    subject: `Email Delivery Failed: ${failure.recipientEmail}`,
    html: generateFailureNotificationHTML(failure),
    fromEmail: 'notifications@musobuddy.com',
    fromName: 'MusoBuddy Notifications'
  });

  await storage.markEmailFailureAsNotified(failure.id);
}
```
