# Email Deliverability Status & Configuration

## Current Setup ✅

### Dual-Provider Routing (Configured)
Your system intelligently routes emails based on recipient domain for optimal deliverability:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Recipient Domain Routing Logic    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Yahoo/AOL        → Mailgun          │
│ Microsoft        → Mailgun          │
│ (Hotmail/Outlook/Live/MSN)          │
│ All Others       → SendGrid         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**File:** `server/core/email-provider-abstraction.ts`

### Why This Configuration?

1. **Mailgun for Microsoft** (Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN)
   - ✅ Rotating IPs bypass Microsoft's strict blocklists
   - ✅ Resolves 550 5.7.1 blocklist errors
   - ✅ Better reputation with Microsoft servers

2. **Mailgun for Yahoo/AOL**
   - ✅ Historically better deliverability
   - ✅ Reduced delays (Yahoo 24hr delays resolved)
   - ✅ Lower bounce rates

3. **SendGrid for Everything Else**
   - ✅ Gmail, custom domains, etc.
   - ✅ Good general deliverability
   - ✅ Modern API and features

## Recent Issues & Resolution

### Issue: Microsoft Blocking SendGrid IPs
**Error:** `550 5.7.1 Unfortunately, messages from [159.183.224.104] weren't sent`

**Root Cause:** SendGrid shared IP (159.183.224.104) was on Microsoft's blocklist

**Solution Implemented:** Route all Microsoft domains through Mailgun's rotating IPs

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (as of 2025-10-12)

## Email Authentication Status

### DNS Records to Verify

Check these DNS records are properly configured:

#### 1. SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework)
```
Type: TXT
Host: @musobuddy.com
Value: v=spf1 include:mailgun.org include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

#### 2. DKIM Records (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

**For Mailgun:**
```
Type: TXT
Host: k1._domainkey.musobuddy.com
Value: [Get from Mailgun dashboard]
```

**For SendGrid:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: s1._domainkey.musobuddy.com
Value: [Get from SendGrid dashboard]
```

#### 3. DMARC Record (Domain-based Message Authentication)
```
Type: TXT
Host: _dmarc.musobuddy.com
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@musobuddy.com
```

### How to Verify Authentication

1. **Check SPF:**
   ```bash
   dig musobuddy.com TXT
   ```

2. **Check DKIM:**
   ```bash
   dig k1._domainkey.musobuddy.com TXT
   ```

3. **Check DMARC:**
   ```bash
   dig _dmarc.musobuddy.com TXT
   ```

4. **Send Test Email:**
   - Send to https://www.mail-tester.com
   - Check score (aim for 10/10)
   - Review authentication results

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Email Content Best Practices

#### Avoid Spam Triggers
- ❌ ALL CAPS SUBJECT LINES
- ❌ Excessive exclamation marks!!!
- ❌ Words like "FREE", "ACT NOW", "CLICK HERE"
- ❌ Too many links (keep to 2-3 max)
- ❌ Image-only emails (always include text)

#### Good Practices
- ✅ Personalize with recipient name
- ✅ Include plain text version
- ✅ Maintain good text-to-image ratio
- ✅ Include physical address in footer
- ✅ Clear unsubscribe link (if applicable)
- ✅ Consistent "From" name and email

### 2. List Hygiene

**Implement Bounce Handling:**
```javascript
// Remove hard bounces immediately
// Track soft bounces and remove after 3 attempts
// Remove unengaged recipients after 6 months
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Implementation

### 3. Sending Patterns

**Current:** Dynamic throttling based on API usage
- Low usage: 0.5s delay between emails
- Moderate: 1.5s delay
- High: 2s delay

**Recommendation:** ✅ Already implemented

### 4. Engagement Tracking

**Current:** Tracking disabled for auth emails, enabled for others

**Recommendation:**
- Enable open tracking for better reputation
- Monitor engagement rates
- Remove consistently non-engaging recipients

## Monitoring & Testing

### Regular Checks

1. **Weekly:**
   - Check bounce rates in SendGrid dashboard
   - Check bounce rates in Mailgun dashboard
   - Review any delivery failures

2. **Monthly:**
   - Run test emails through mail-tester.com
   - Check sender reputation at:
     - https://senderscore.org
     - https://www.sendgrid.com/sender-score
   - Review Microsoft SNDS (if registered)

3. **Per Campaign:**
   - Monitor open rates (should be >15%)
   - Monitor bounce rates (should be <5%)
   - Monitor complaint rates (should be <0.1%)

### Testing Email Deliverability

```bash
# Send test emails to:
# 1. mail-tester.com (get deliverability score)
# 2. Your own Hotmail account
# 3. Your own Gmail account
# 4. Your own Yahoo account
```
