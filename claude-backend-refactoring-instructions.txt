CLAUDE BACKEND REFACTORING TASK - CONTEXT

You are refactoring a music business app to rename "enquiries" to "bookings" throughout the codebase for consistency with the UI. The frontend has already been updated - now you need to update the backend files.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. Database table name stays "enquiries" - DO NOT CHANGE IT
2. Only change code references, variable names, function names, and comments
3. Focus on these 3 files only: server/storage.ts, server/routes.ts, server/index.ts

REFACTORING SCOPE:
- Change all variable names from "enquiry/enquiries" to "booking/bookings"
- Change all function names from "enquiry/enquiries" to "booking/bookings"
- Change all comments from "enquiry/enquiries" to "booking/bookings"
- Change all route paths from "/enquiries" to "/bookings"
- Change all API endpoint references from "enquiries" to "bookings"
- Update all error messages and logs to use "booking" terminology
- Keep database table name as "enquiries" (this is the ONLY exception)

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS:
- Function: getEnquiries() → getBookings()
- Variable: enquiryData → bookingData
- Route: /api/enquiries → /api/bookings
- Comment: "Create new enquiry" → "Create new booking"
- Error: "Enquiry not found" → "Booking not found"

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This is a terminology consistency update only
- No functional changes to the code logic
- Database schema remains unchanged
- All database queries still reference the "enquiries" table
- Only change the external-facing API and internal code references

Please process each file systematically, changing all instances of "enquiry/enquiries" to "booking/bookings" while preserving all database table references as "enquiries".
