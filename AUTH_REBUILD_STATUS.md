# üî• AUTH REBUILD STATUS - December 17, 2024

## WHAT WE'RE DOING
**COMPLETE REBUILD** of authentication middleware. Burning down the old complex system and replacing with clean, simple Supabase-only auth.

## SAFETY NET
**Backup commit created:** `eaf5d24b3` - "BACKUP: Before auth rebuild - complex but partially working auth system"

## CURRENT PROGRESS ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
1. **Backup created** - Full git commit of working state
2. **New middleware created** - `/server/middleware/supabase-only-auth.ts` (80 lines, clean)
3. **All routes updated** - 28 route files now import new middleware
4. **Old middleware DELETED** - Removed 5 old auth files:
   - `auth.ts` (300+ lines of complexity) ‚ùå DELETED
   - `auth-bridge.ts` ‚ùå DELETED
   - `firebase-auth.ts` ‚ùå DELETED
   - `simple-auth.ts` (300+ lines) ‚ùå DELETED
   - `supabase-auth.ts` ‚ùå DELETED

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
5. **Build test passed** - No import errors, TypeScript compilation successful

### üöß IN PROGRESS:
6. **Testing authentication flow** - About to test login and API calls

### ‚è≥ TODO:
7. **Verify all routes work** - Test core features (bookings, contracts, etc.)

## IF SESSION DISAPPEARS - EMERGENCY INSTRUCTIONS

### TO CONTINUE THE REBUILD:
1. The new middleware file is: `/server/middleware/supabase-only-auth.ts`
2. Test it works: `npm run build` then start server and test login
3. If auth works, you're done!
4. If auth fails, see rollback below

### TO ROLLBACK (GET BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED):
```bash
git reset --hard eaf5d24b3
npm install
# You're back to the complex but partially working system
```

## NEW MIDDLEWARE LOGIC (SIMPLE)
1. Extract token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. Use environment to pick DEV or PROD Supabase client
3. Call `supabase.auth.getUser(token)` to verify
4. Look up user in database by Supabase UID or email
5. Attach user to `req.user`
6. Done.

**No more:**
- Project detection from JWT
- Firebase fallbacks
- Multiple middleware files
- Complex token parsing

## FILES THAT MATTER
- **New auth:** `/server/middleware/supabase-only-auth.ts`
- **Routes:** All 28 route files in `/server/routes/` now use new auth
- **Backup:** Git commit `eaf5d24b3`

**Status:** üöß Mid-rebuild - testing phase
**Risk:** Medium (have backup)
**Next:** Test authentication flow
