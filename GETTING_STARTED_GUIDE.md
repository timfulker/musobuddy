## Welcome to MusoBuddy!

MusoBuddy is your all-in-one platform for managing music bookings, contracts, invoices, and client communications. This guide will help you set up your account properly so you can start managing your music business professionally.

## Why Settings Matter

Before you can create bookings, send invoices, or generate contracts, MusoBuddy needs to know about **your business**. Think of the Settings page as the foundation of your entire workflow:

- **Your business information** appears on all contracts and invoices
- **Your email settings** control how clients receive communications from you
- **Your payment terms** determine invoice due dates automatically
- **Your bank details** tell clients where to pay you
- **Your pricing guide** helps AI suggest appropriate fees

**Bottom line:** A few minutes spent setting up your profile now will save hours of manual work later.

## Essential Settings Checklist

Here's what you need to configure before creating your first booking:

### ✅ **1. Business Information** (CRITICAL - Required First)

**What it is:** Your professional identity that appears on all documents.

**Where it's used:**
- Every invoice you generate
- Every contract you send
- Email footers and signatures
- Client communications

**What to fill in:**
- **Business Name:** Your stage name, band name, or legal business name
- **Business Contact Email:** The email clients will see and reply to (e.g., bookings@yourname.com)
- **Phone Number:** Your professional contact number
- **Business Address:** Street address, city, postcode (appears on invoices and contracts)
- **Home Address (optional):** For distance calculations to gig venues

**Why it matters:**
Without this information, your invoices and contracts will be incomplete and look unprofessional. Clients need to know who they're paying and how to contact you.

---

### ✅ **2. Email Settings** (CRITICAL - Required for Communication)

**What it is:** Controls how emails are sent to clients on your behalf.

**Where it's used:**
- Booking confirmations
- Contract notifications
- Invoice reminders
- Support communications

**What to fill in:**
- **Email From Name:** The name that appears in clients' inboxes (e.g., "Sarah at MusoBuddy" or "Tim's Jazz Quartet")
- **Email Signature:** Text that appears at the bottom of every email sent to clients
- **Email Subject Prefix:** (**CRITICAL - REQUIRED**) A prefix for all outgoing emails (e.g., "[Jazz Bookings]" or "[Sarah's Music]"). This is what MusoBuddy uses to send emails on your behalf—without this, email communication will not work.
- **Personal Forward Email (optional):** If you want copies of client emails forwarded to your personal inbox

**Why it matters:**
**The Email Subject Prefix is essential for MusoBuddy to send emails.** Without it configured, automated notifications about bookings, contracts, and invoices cannot be sent to clients. This setting essentially gives MusoBuddy permission to send emails on your behalf using your chosen branding.

---

### ✅ **3. Contract & Invoice Settings** (CRITICAL - Required for Payments)

**What it is:** Your default payment terms and legal clauses.

**Where it's used:**
- **Payment Terms:** Auto-calculates invoice due dates for every booking
- **Invoice Numbering:** Keeps your invoices organized and sequential
- **Contract Clauses:** Standard terms that protect you legally
- **Invoice Clauses:** Payment policies that appear on invoices

**What to fill in:**

#### Payment Terms (choose one):
- **28/14/7 days before performance:** Client pays before the gig
- **On performance date:** Client pays on the day
- **7/14/28 days after performance:** Client pays after the gig
- **Net 7/14/30 days:** Client pays within X days of receiving invoice
- **Cash as agreed:** Custom arrangement

**Note:** When you create a booking, MusoBuddy automatically calculates the invoice due date based on:
- The performance date
- Your default payment terms setting

#### Invoice Numbering:
- **Invoice Prefix:** A custom prefix for invoice numbers (e.g., "MB-" for "MB-001", "MB-002")
- **Next Invoice Number:** The starting number (usually 1 or 1001)

#### Contract Clauses (tick the ones you want to include):
Standard legal protections like:
- Deposit requirements
- Cancellation policy
- Venue access requirements
- Power supply needs
- Weather protection (for outdoor gigs)
- Guest numbers confirmation
- Recording restrictions

#### Invoice Clauses (tick the ones you want to include):
Payment policies like:
- Payment due date
- Late payment charges
- Deposit policy
- Cancellation terms
- Accepted payment methods
- Bank details visibility
- Tax compliance statements

**Why it matters:**
- Without payment terms, MusoBuddy doesn't know when to set invoice due dates
- Without contract clauses, you have no legal protection
- Without invoice clauses, clients don't know your payment policies

**Example:**
If you set payment terms to "7 days after performance" and create a booking for June 15th, MusoBuddy will automatically create an invoice due on June 22nd.

---

### ✅ **4. Bank Details** (CRITICAL - Required for Getting Paid)

**What it is:** Where clients send payment.

**Where it's used:**
- Displayed on invoices (if you enable the "Bank Details" invoice clause)
- Shown to clients when they view invoices

**What to fill in:**
```
Bank Name: Your Bank Name
Account Name: Your Name or Business Name
Sort Code: 12-34-56
Account Number: 12345678
```

**Why it matters:**
Clients can't pay you if they don't know where to send the money. This appears directly on invoices when enabled.

---

### ✅ **5. AI Pricing Guide** (RECOMMENDED - Saves Time)

**What it is:** Your standard rates that help AI suggest appropriate fees.

**Where it's used:**
- When creating new bookings, AI can suggest pricing
- Helps you price consistently
- Speeds up quote generation

**What to fill in:**
- **Base Hourly Rate:** Your standard hourly fee (e.g., £130/hour)
- **Minimum Booking Hours:** Shortest gig you'll accept (e.g., 2 hours)
- **Additional Hour Rate:** Fee for hours beyond minimum (e.g., £60/hour)
- **DJ Service Rate:** If you also DJ (optional)
- **Pricing Notes:** Any special pricing rules or context for AI
- **Special Offers:** Current promotions or discounts

**Why it matters:**
When you create a booking, you can ask AI to suggest a price based on:
- Event type (wedding, corporate, pub gig)
- Duration
- Travel distance
- Your standard rates

Without these rates configured, AI can't help you price accurately.

---

### ✅ **6. Instrument & AI Context** (RECOMMENDED - Improves AI Suggestions)

**What it is:** What instrument(s) you play, which helps AI understand your work.

**Where it's used:**
- AI suggestions for gig types
- Contract and invoice wording
- Pricing recommendations

**What to fill in:**
- **Primary Instrument:** Your main instrument (e.g., Saxophone, Piano, Guitar)
- **Secondary Instruments:** Additional instruments you play

**Why it matters:**
When AI knows you're a saxophonist, it can:
- Suggest appropriate gig types (jazz clubs, weddings, functions)
- Use relevant language in contracts
- Understand typical pricing for your instrument
- Provide context-aware suggestions

---

### ✅ **7. Performance Settings** (OPTIONAL - Quality of Life)

**What it is:** App preferences for displaying bookings and calculating distances.

**Where it's used:**
- Dashboard and booking list views
- Distance calculations to venues

**What to fill in:**
- **Booking Display Limit:** Show 50 bookings or all bookings
- **Distance Units:** Miles or kilometers

**Why it matters:**
These settings don't affect functionality, but they improve your experience by showing information the way you prefer.

---

### ✅ **8. Booking Widget** (OPTIONAL - For Your Website)

**What it is:** An embeddable form clients can use to request bookings directly from your website.

**Where it's used:**
- Your personal website
- Social media profiles
- Email signatures (as a link)

**What to do:**
1. Click "Generate Widget Token"
2. Copy the provided HTML code
3. Paste it into your website
4. Download the QR code to share the booking form link

**Why it matters:**
Clients can request bookings 24/7 without emailing you. Requests appear automatically in your MusoBuddy dashboard.

---

### ✅ **9. App Theme** (OPTIONAL - Visual Customization)

**What it is:** Color scheme for the MusoBuddy interface.

**Where it's used:**
- Your dashboard and all pages in the app

**What to choose:**
- Purple (default)
- Ocean Blue
- Forest Green
- Clean Pro Audio
- Midnight Blue
- Or create a custom color

**Why it matters:**
This is purely aesthetic—it doesn't affect functionality, but it can make the app feel more "yours."

---

### ✅ **10. Invoice & Contract Templates** (ADVANCED - For Customization)

**What it is:** Visual styling for generated invoices and contracts.

**Where it's used:**
- PDFs sent to clients

**What to customize:**
- **Template Style:** Classic, Modern, or Minimal
- **Tone:** Professional, Friendly, or Creative
- **Font:** Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Georgia, Roboto
- **Accent Color:** Your brand color
- **Logo:** Upload your business logo
- **Banner:** Upload a header image
- **Custom Title:** Change "Invoice" to something else (e.g., "Performance Summary")

**Why it matters:**
Professional-looking documents build credibility. Clients take you more seriously when your invoices look polished.

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to fill in every setting?

**A:** No, but the **critical** settings (Business Info, Payment Terms, Bank Details, Email Settings) are required for the app to function properly. Without them:
- Invoices will be incomplete
- Due dates won't calculate correctly
- Clients won't know how to pay you
- Emails will look unprofessional

### Q: Can I change settings later?

**A:** Yes! You can update settings anytime. Changes apply to **new** bookings and invoices, but **existing** documents remain unchanged.

### Q: What happens if I don't set payment terms?

**A:** MusoBuddy won't know when invoices are due. When you create a booking, the due date will be NULL in the database, which may cause invoices to default to incorrect due dates.

### Q: Why do I need to set an email signature?

**A:** MusoBuddy sends automated emails to clients (booking confirmations, contract notifications, invoice reminders). Your email signature makes these communications feel personal and professional rather than robotic.

### Q: Can I have different payment terms for different clients?

**A:** Yes! The settings define your **default** payment terms, but you can customize them for each individual booking when you create it.

### Q: What if I don't have a business address yet?

**A:** You can use your home address. Many solo musicians work from home, and it's perfectly acceptable to use your residential address on invoices.

### Q: What's the difference between "Business Contact Email" and "Email From Name"?

**A:**
- **Business Contact Email:** The actual email address that appears on invoices and contracts (e.g., bookings@yourname.com)
- **Email From Name:** The friendly name clients see in their inbox (e.g., "Sarah at MusoBuddy")

## What Happens If Settings Are Incomplete?

| Missing Setting | What Breaks | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Business Name** | Invoices and contracts | Documents look unprofessional, clients don't know who they're paying |
| **Email Subject Prefix** | **All email communication** | **Emails cannot be sent to clients at all** |
| **Payment Terms** | Invoice due dates | Due dates are NULL or incorrect |
| **Bank Details** | Payment instructions | Clients don't know where to send money |
| **Email From Name** | Email headers | Emails look automated and impersonal |
| **Next Invoice Number** | Invoice numbering | Invoice numbers restart at 1 every time |
