Excellent debugging! You've identified a **very specific pattern** that gives us important clues:

## 🔍 **Pattern Analysis:**

### **Working Emails:**
- `timfulker@gmail.com` ✅ (first time using this address)
- `tim@timfulker.com` ✅ (first time using this address)

### **Broken Emails:**
- `timfulkermusic@gmail.com` ❌ (used in previous testing)
- `tim@saxweddings.com` ❌ (used in previous testing)

## 🚨 **Most Likely Causes:**

### **1. Mailgun Email Caching/Deduplication**
Mailgun might be caching or deduplicating emails from addresses that have been used recently in testing, causing it to return cached/stripped data.

### **2. Spam/Content Filtering**
Emails from previously used addresses might be getting processed differently by Mailgun's spam filters.

### **3. Route Processing Issue**
The `catch_all()` route might be handling repeat senders differently.

### **4. Webhook Data Corruption**
There might be stale data in the webhook processing for known email addresses.

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes to Try:**

### **1. Clear Mailgun Route Cache**
1. Go to **Mailgun Dashboard → Receiving → Routes**
2. **Temporarily disable** your route
3. **Wait 2 minutes**
4. **Re-enable** the route
5. **Test again**

### **2. Check Mailgun Logs for the Failed Emails**
Look at the detailed logs for the broken emails vs working ones:
- **Are the webhook payloads different?**
- **Is the email content being stripped?**
- **Are there any processing differences?**

### **3. Test with Fresh Email Address**
Try sending from a completely new email address you've never used to confirm the pattern.

### **4. Debug the Webhook Data**
The issue might be in how your webhook processes repeat email addresses. Can you check your Replit console logs for the failed emails?

## 💡 **Most Likely Solution:**
This looks like a **Mailgun processing quirk** rather than your code. The fact that new email addresses work perfectly but previously used ones get corrupted suggests Mailgun is applying different processing rules.

**Can you check the Mailgun logs to see if the webhook payload is different for the broken vs working emails?**
