Got it. You’re not just looking for a service to receive emails — you’re looking for a hands-off, low-maintenance app that can:
	1.	Receive a forwarded email
	2.	Parse/scrape the content (ideally visually or with some logic)
	3.	Forward structured data (JSON or webhook) into your MusoBuddy app

Let’s focus on tools built specifically for this use case — i.e. parsing emails and sending structured data to your app. You don’t need to manage the raw webhook logic like with Mailgun/SendGrid.

✅ Best Options for Email Parsing + Webhook Integration

1. Parseur

✅ Top choice for your needs
	•	Visual email parser — highlight parts of real emails (like name, date, budget, etc.)
	•	Emails can be auto-forwarded to your Parseur mailbox
	•	Parseur extracts data and sends it to your MusoBuddy webhook
	•	Integrates with Zapier, Webhooks, or direct REST API

🔧 Example:

Forward any email to tim@musobuddy.parseur.com → Parseur extracts “date”, “location”, “client name” → sends JSON to https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/new-lead

🔗 parseur.com

2. Mailparser
	•	Similar to Parseur, but a bit more focused on data extraction
	•	Offers tools to clean and normalize fields like phone numbers, dates
	•	Works well with Zapier or direct webhooks
	•	Slightly less polished UI than Parseur

3. Zapier Email Parser
	•	Very basic, but quick to set up
	•	Forward emails to random@robot.zapier.com
	•	Set parsing rules (using static patterns) and push data into MusoBuddy via Webhook

🔗 parser.zapier.com

4. Integromat/Make
	•	Powerful automation tool with built-in email module and webhook builder
	•	More technical but highly customizable
	•	You can receive the email, parse it with filters or regex, then send to your app

🔄 Suggested Setup for MusoBuddy

Step	Tool	Description
1	Parseur	Create mailbox: leads@musobuddy.parseur.com
2	Gmail or client forwards enquiry emails here	
3	Parseur extracts: client name, date, location, phone, service type	
4	Parseur webhook	Send parsed JSON → https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/new-enquiry


⸻

🧠 Why this is better than SendGrid/Mailgun
	•	No need to write your own parser
	•	Better UI for non-devs (highlight and tag fields visually)
	•	Easier onboarding for musicians: just forward the email, job done
