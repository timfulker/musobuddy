Got it! You're looking for UX strategy around conflict notifications. Here are some better approaches than just turning everything red:

## Visual Strategy for Conflict Notifications

### **Graduated Conflict Indicators**
- **Green**: No conflicts
- **Yellow/Amber**: Soft conflicts (same day, different times/venues)
- **Orange**: Potential overlaps (AI detected risk)
- **Red**: Hard conflicts (definite time/venue clash)

### **Smart Highlighting Strategy**

**Option 1: Primary vs Secondary**
- Primary enquiry (newer/higher priority): Gets warning border
- Conflicting enquiry: Gets subtle indicator (dot, icon)
- Avoids the "everything's broken" feeling

**Option 2: Relationship-Based**
- Same client conflicts: Blue border (often resolvable)
- Different client conflicts: Red border (more serious)
- Venue conflicts: Orange border
- Equipment conflicts: Yellow border

### **AI-Powered Notification Hierarchy**

**Critical (Red + Block Action)**
- AI says "definitely can't work"
- Exact time/venue overlap
- Confirmed booking vs new enquiry

**Warning (Orange + Proceed with Caution)**
- AI says "risky but possible"
- Tight timing between venues
- Resource constraints

**Info (Blue + Just Notify)**
- AI says "worth mentioning"
- Same client, different events
- Potential efficiency gains

### **Interactive Conflict Resolution**

**Instead of static red borders:**
- Hover reveals conflict details
- Click opens resolution panel
- Show AI suggestions inline
- Quick action buttons (reschedule, reassign venue, etc.)

### **Calendar-Specific Strategies**

**Timeline View:**
- Overlapping blocks with transparency
- Color intensity = conflict severity
- Connecting lines between conflicting events

**Day View:**
- Stacked conflicting events
- Visual "collision" indicators
- Time buffer zones highlighted

**Smart Grouping:**
- Cluster related conflicts
- Show "3 conflicts" badge instead of highlighting everything
- Progressive disclosure of conflict details

### **Notification Timing**

**Immediate (Real-time):**
- Hard conflicts during booking attempt
- Staff assignment conflicts

**Batched (Daily digest):**
- Soft conflicts for review
- Upcoming potential issues
- AI-suggested optimizations

**Contextual:**
- Show conflicts when viewing specific dates
- Hide resolved conflicts
- Highlight new conflicts since last view

The key is making conflicts **informative, not alarming** - guide users toward solutions rather than just showing problems.
