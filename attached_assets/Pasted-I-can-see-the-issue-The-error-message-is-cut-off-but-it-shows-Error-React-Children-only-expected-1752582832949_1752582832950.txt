I can see the issue! The error message is cut off but it shows `"Error: React.Children.only expected to receive a single"` which is a React component structure error, not a variable reference error.

This error typically occurs when a React component that expects only one child element receives multiple children or no children.

## Most Likely Culprit

Looking at your `settings.tsx` file, I suspect the issue is in one of these areas:

### 1. Form Component Structure Issue

The error is likely in your form structure. Let me check your `Form` component usage:### 2. Quick Debugging Steps

**Step 1: Simplify the component temporarily**

Replace your entire settings component temporarily with this minimal version to test:**Step 2: If the minimal version works, gradually add back pieces:**

1. Add the imports one by one
2. Add the state variables
3. Add the form structure
4. Add the complex components

### 3. Most Common Fixes

**Check your FormField structure** - Make sure every FormField has exactly this structure:

```tsx
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="fieldName"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Label</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

**Check for missing components** - The error might be from a missing import. Verify all these are imported:

```tsx
import { Form, FormControl, FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormMessage } from "@/components/ui/form";
```

### 4. Alternative Approach

If the form structure is the issue, try temporarily replacing the complex form sections with simple divs to isolate which part is causing the error:

```tsx
{/* Instead of the complex instrument selection, try: */}
<div>
  <h4>Instrument Selection (Temporarily Disabled)</h4>
  <p>This section is disabled for testing</p>
</div>
```

### 5. Check Browser Console

Please check the browser console (F12 â†’ Console) for the **complete** error message. The full error should tell us exactly which component is causing the `React.Children.only` error.

**Which approach should we try first?** I recommend starting with the minimal component test to confirm the route and basic structure work, then gradually building back up to identify the problematic component.
