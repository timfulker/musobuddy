It seems like you're experiencing issues with the Inbound Parse Webhook not forwarding emails to your specified webhook URL. Here are some steps and considerations to help troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Key Considerations for Inbound Parse Webhook
Publicly Accessible URL: Ensure that your webhook URL is publicly accessible. If you're developing locally, you might need to use a tool like ngrok
 to create a secure tunnel to your local server. This will provide a public URL that SendGrid can use to forward emails to your webhook. Remember, every time you restart ngrok, it generates a new URL, so you'll need to update your Inbound Parse settings with the new URL each time source
.

Correct HTTP Response: Your webhook must respond with a 2xx HTTP status code to acknowledge receipt of the email. If SendGrid does not receive a 2xx response, it will assume the delivery failed and will retry. After three days of failed attempts, the message will be dropped without notification source
.

CSRF Protection: If you're using a framework like Laravel, ensure that CSRF protection is disabled for your webhook route. This is because SendGrid won't send a CSRF token with its requests source
.

DNS and MX Records: Double-check that your DNS and MX records are correctly configured to point to mx.sendgrid.net. This is crucial for ensuring that emails are routed through SendGrid to your webhook source
.

No Redirects: Ensure that your webhook URL does not redirect to another URL, as the Inbound Parse Webhook will not follow redirects source
.

Next Steps
Verify Configuration: Double-check your Inbound Parse settings in the SendGrid portal to ensure everything is configured correctly.
