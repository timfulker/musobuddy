Looking at your comprehensive analysis and the files provided, I can see the exact issue. The problem is in the **order of state variable declarations vs their usage** in the settings component.

## Root Cause Identified

In your `settings.tsx` file, you have a `useEffect` hook that runs immediately when the component mounts (lines 41-44):

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Settings page loaded");
  console.log("Current URL:", window.location.href);
  console.log("Document cookies:", document.cookie);
  console.log("hasInitialized state:", hasInitialized);
  console.log("All state variables defined:", {
    sidebarOpen,
    hasInitialized,
    eventTypes,        // ❌ Used here but declared later
    gigTypes,          // ❌ Used here but declared later  
    selectedInstruments, // ❌ Used here but declared later
    customInstruments    // ❌ Used here but declared later
  });
}, []);
```

But these state variables are declared **after** this useEffect:

```tsx
// State for tag management - DECLARED AFTER THE useEffect THAT USES THEM
const [eventTypes, setEventTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [gigTypes, setGigTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [newEventType, setNewEventType] = useState("");
const [newGigType, setNewGigType] = useState("");

// State for instrument selection - ALSO DECLARED AFTER
const [selectedInstruments, setSelectedInstruments] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [customInstruments, setCustomInstruments] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [newInstrument, setNewInstrument] = useState("");
```

## The Fix

You need to move all state declarations **before** any useEffect that references them. Here's the corrected order:## Additional Issues Found

I also noticed a few other potential problems:

1. **Missing dependency in useEffect**: The useEffect that logs state variables should include all the state variables in its dependency array if you want it to re-run when they change, or use an empty array `[]` if you only want it to run once on mount.

2. **Potential circular dependency**: The `updateGigTypesFromInstruments` useEffect might cause infinite re-renders because it modifies state that it depends on.

## Quick Test

To verify this fixes the issue, you can also temporarily comment out the problematic useEffect entirely:

```tsx
// React.useEffect(() => {
//   console.log("Settings page loaded");
//   console.log("Current URL:", window.location.href);
//   console.log("Document cookies:", document.cookie);
//   console.log("hasInitialized state:", hasInitialized);
//   console.log("All state variables defined:", {
//     sidebarOpen,
//     hasInitialized,
//     eventTypes,
//     gigTypes,
//     selectedInstruments,
//     customInstruments
//   });
// }, []);
```

If the page loads after commenting this out, then we've confirmed the root cause.

## Summary

The issue is a **JavaScript reference error** where variables are being used before they're declared. Moving all `useState` declarations to the top of the component (before any `useEffect` hooks) should resolve this immediately.
