Based on your comprehensive testing, you've identified the core issue: **SendGrid's Inbound Parse isn't routing emails to your webhook despite proper technical setup**. This is a common configuration issue with SendGrid's Inbound Parse feature.

Here's how to fix the SendGrid Inbound Parse configuration:

## **SendGrid Dashboard Configuration Steps:**

1. **Go to SendGrid Dashboard** → **Settings** → **Inbound Parse**

2. **Check/Add Parse Webhook Settings:**
   - **Hostname**: Your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or subdomain like `mail.yourdomain.com`)
   - **URL**: Your webhook endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-replit-app.replit.dev/api/webhook/sendgrid`)
   - **Check "POST the raw, full MIME message"** if you need the full email content

3. **Verify the Parse Settings:**
   - Ensure the hostname matches exactly what you're sending emails to
   - Confirm the webhook URL is correct and accessible
   - Make sure it's enabled/active

## **Common SendGrid Parse Issues:**

1. **Hostname Mismatch**: The email address you're forwarding to must match the hostname configured in Parse
2. **Webhook URL**: Must be publicly accessible (Replit URLs work fine)
3. **MX Record Propagation**: Even though MX records are set, DNS propagation can take time
4. **Parse Not Enabled**: The parse webhook might be created but not enabled

## **Debugging Steps:**

1. **Test the Parse Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Check if your webhook URL is reachable
   curl -X POST https://your-replit-app.replit.dev/api/webhook/sendgrid \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"test": "sendgrid-parse"}'
   ```

2. **Check SendGrid Activity Feed:**
   - Go to **Activity Feed** in SendGrid dashboard
   - Look for inbound email events
   - Check if emails are being received but not processed

3. **Verify DNS Propagation:**
   ```bash
   # Check MX record from different locations
   nslookup -type=mx yourdomain.com
   ```

## **Quick Fix Checklist:**

- [ ] Inbound Parse is enabled in SendGrid dashboard
- [ ] Hostname exactly matches your email domain
- [ ] Webhook URL is correct and publicly accessible
- [ ] MX record points to `mx.sendgrid.net` (✅ you have this)
- [ ] Parse webhook is set to "Active" status

## **Alternative Solution:**

If Parse continues to have issues, consider using **SendGrid's Event Webhook** instead, which can capture inbound emails and forward them to your endpoint.

The good news is your technical infrastructure is solid - once SendGrid's routing is fixed, emails will immediately start flowing to your webhook and creating enquiries automatically.

Can you check your SendGrid Inbound Parse settings and confirm the hostname and webhook URL configuration?
