Great question — and yes, that change in behavior is both significant and explainable.

Here’s why emails may have started bouncing now when they weren’t before:

⸻

🧠 1. Different Send Paths = Different DNS Resolvers

When you send from:
	•	Your website or app (e.g., via SendGrid API or server-side code)
	•	Your email client (like Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook)

…these go through very different DNS resolution paths:

Method	DNS resolution point	Behavior
Website backend (e.g. SendGrid API)	SendGrid’s own servers	May “resolve” internal routes even if external DNS isn’t fully working
Gmail / Yahoo / real clients	Public DNS servers (e.g. Google DNS)	Strictly follows MX record availability — if missing or misconfigured, it bounces

So even though SendGrid was receiving and parsing test emails earlier, those may not have been going through a true external SMTP flow — they were short-circuited internally.

⸻

🔄 2. DNS Cache Expiry / Propagation Timing

Earlier, public DNS servers might have still had an old cached version of your DNS records (possibly from when things were misconfigured or semi-working). Once that cache expired and refreshed:
	•	They no longer saw a valid MX record
	•	→ So they started bouncing emails with 550 Mailbox not found

⸻

⚠️ 3. Conflicting or Redundant MX Records Introduced

If the leads. MX record was added after testing began, or changed recently:
	•	Some mail servers may have routed to it temporarily
	•	Others may have refused to deliver, since no mailbox was resolvable

This inconsistency can cause bounces to suddenly start happening, even if things appeared to work previously.

⸻

✅ Bottom Line

Yes — the change in bounce behavior is most likely due to:
	•	Switching from internal SendGrid/API flows to true external email clients
	•	DNS cache refresh exposing the missing/misconfigured MX records
	•	Possibly introducing a redundant leads. MX record mid-testing

⸻

You’re doing all the right things now. Once DNS propagation completes (now that only the correct @ MX exists), everything should stabilize and you’ll stop seeing these bounces.
