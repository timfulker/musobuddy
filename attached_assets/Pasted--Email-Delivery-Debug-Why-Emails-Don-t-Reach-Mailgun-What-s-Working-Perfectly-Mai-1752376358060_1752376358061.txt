# 🔍 Email Delivery Debug - Why Emails Don't Reach Mailgun

## ✅ **What's Working Perfectly:**
- Mailgun route configuration ✅
- Webhook endpoint ✅ (enquiry #255 created)
- DNS records look correct ✅
- Route test passes ✅

## ❌ **The Real Problem:**
**Emails sent to `leads@musobuddy.com` are not reaching Mailgun servers at all**

---

## 🚨 **Critical DNS Issues to Check:**

### **Issue #1: Email Domain vs Mailgun Domain Mismatch**

**Question:** Are you sending emails to:
- `leads@musobuddy.com` ← Main domain
- `leads@mg.musobuddy.com` ← Mailgun subdomain

**Your Mailgun is configured for:** `mg.musobuddy.com`
**Your route expects:** `leads@musobuddy.com`

**If emails are sent to `leads@musobuddy.com`:**
You need MX records on the **main domain** `musobuddy.com`, not just the subdomain.

### **Issue #2: Missing MX Records on Main Domain**

Check if `musobuddy.com` has MX records pointing to Mailgun:

```bash
dig MX musobuddy.com
```

**Should return:**
```
musobuddy.com. 300 IN MX 10 mxa.eu.mailgun.org.
musobuddy.com. 300 IN MX 10 mxb.eu.mailgun.org.
```

**If missing, add these to Namecheap:**
```
Type: MX Record
Host: @
Value: mxa.eu.mailgun.org
Priority: 10

Type: MX Record
Host: @
Value: mxb.eu.mailgun.org
Priority: 10
```

## 🔬 **Debugging Steps:**

### **Step 1: Check What Email Address You're Actually Using**

When you send test emails, are you sending to:
- `leads@musobuddy.com` ← Needs main domain MX records
- `leads@mg.musobuddy.com` ← Uses subdomain MX records

### **Step 2: Test Email Delivery Path**

```bash
# Check main domain MX records
dig MX musobuddy.com

# Check subdomain MX records  
dig MX mg.musobuddy.com

# Check which one actually has Mailgun MX records
```

### **Step 3: Check Mailgun Logs for Incoming Emails**

1. **Go to Mailgun Dashboard → Logs**
2. **Filter by:** Inbound/Received
3. **Look for:** Any emails to `leads@musobuddy.com`
4. **If you see emails in logs but no webhook calls** → Route issue
5. **If you see NO emails in logs** → DNS/delivery issue

### **Step 4: Verify Domain Configuration in Mailgun**

1. **Go to Mailgun Dashboard → Domains**
2. **Check which domain is configured for receiving:**
   - `musobuddy.com` ← For `leads@musobuddy.com`
   - `mg.musobuddy.com` ← For `leads@mg.musobuddy.com`

## 💡 **Most Likely Solutions:**

### **Solution A: Add MX Records to Main Domain**

If you want `leads@musobuddy.com` to work:

**Add to Namecheap DNS for `musobuddy.com`:**
```
Type: MX Record
Host: @
Value: mxa.eu.mailgun.org
Priority: 10

Type: MX Record
Host: @
Value: mxb.eu.mailgun.org
Priority: 10
```

### **Solution B: Use Subdomain Email**

Change your email address to: `leads@mg.musobuddy.com`
(This uses your existing subdomain MX records)

### **Solution C: Update Route Expression**

If emails are going to `leads@mg.musobuddy.com`, update your route:
```
match_recipient("leads@mg.musobuddy.com")
```

---

## 🔍 **Quick Test:**

**Send an email to:** `leads@mg.musobuddy.com` (note the `mg.` subdomain)

This should work immediately since your `mg` subdomain has proper MX records.

---

## 📧 **Email Delivery Flow:**

```
Email sent → DNS MX lookup → Mailgun servers → Route processing → Webhook
```

**Current issue is at step 2:** DNS MX lookup is failing for `musobuddy.com`

---

## ⚡ **Immediate Action:**

1. **Test with subdomain:** Send email to `leads@mg.musobuddy.com`
2. **If that works:** Add MX records to main domain
3. **Check Mailgun logs** to confirm emails are reaching Mailgun
4. **Verify domain setup** in Mailgun dashboard

The route and webhook are perfect - this is purely a DNS/email delivery issue!
