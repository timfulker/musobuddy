Let me help you debug this step by step. Let's trace where the data is getting lost.Perfect! I found the issue. According to the React Hook Form documentation, `setValue` alone doesn't always trigger the form to mark it as "dirty" (meaning the user has made changes). Let's add the proper options to `setValue`.Now, let's test this step by step:

## Steps to Debug:

1. **Apply the fixes above** to your `settings.tsx`

2. **Add the debug button** temporarily to see what's happening

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Add a custom instrument like "Bagpipes"
   - Click the "🔍 Debug Form State" button
   - Check the console logs
   - Click "Save Settings"
   - Check the console for the submission data

4. **Look for these specific things in the console**:
   ```
   🎯 Added custom instrument: Bagpipes
   🎸 All instruments now: ["saxophone", "bagpipes"]
   🔍 Debug Form State:
   📝 Current form data: { instrumentsPlayed: "[\"saxophone\",\"bagpipes\"]" }
   🎯 Form submission data: { instrumentsPlayed: "[\"saxophone\",\"bagpipes\"]" }
   ```

## If the form data looks correct but still doesn't save:

The issue might be in the backend. Let's also check what the backend is receiving. Add this debug log to your `routes.ts` file in the settings endpoint:

```typescript
app.post('/api/settings', isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.claims.sub;
    console.log("🔥 SETTINGS ENDPOINT - Saving settings for user:", userId);
    console.log("🔥 SETTINGS ENDPOINT - Request body:", JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
    console.log("🔥 SETTINGS ENDPOINT - instrumentsPlayed field:", req.body.instrumentsPlayed);
    
    const settingsData = { ...req.body, userId };
    console.log("🔥 SETTINGS ENDPOINT - Final settings data:", JSON.stringify(settingsData, null, 2));
    
    const settings = await storage.upsertUserSettings(settingsData);
    console.log("🔥 SETTINGS ENDPOINT - Settings saved successfully:", settings);
    res.json(settings);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("🔥 SETTINGS ENDPOINT - Error saving user settings:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to save settings" });
  }
});
```

Try this and let me know what the console logs show! The key thing to check is whether:
1. The form data contains the correct `instrumentsPlayed` value
2. The backend receives that data
3. The database query actually executes
