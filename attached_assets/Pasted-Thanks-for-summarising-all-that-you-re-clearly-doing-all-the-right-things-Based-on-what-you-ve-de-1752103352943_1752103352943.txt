Thanks for summarising all that — you’re clearly doing all the right things. Based on what you’ve described and what’s been tested, here’s a concise view of what’s actually happening and where the snag is:

⸻

✅ What’s Working
	•	SendGrid Webhook: Validated and receiving test POSTs correctly (e.g. enquiries 164–165)
	•	MX Record: Correctly pointing to mx.sendgrid.net at priority 10
	•	Webhook URL: Set to https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/sendgrid — responds with 200
	•	Domain Authentication: Done in SendGrid with unique subdomain
	•	No bouncebacks: Emails aren’t returning to sender, implying no hard rejection

⸻

⚠️ What’s Not Working
	•	Emails sent from Gmail and others aren’t triggering webhook
	•	No logs in SendGrid Activity (which might still be normal, but it’s suspicious at this stage)
	•	No webhook POSTs from real email sends, only manual/test ones

⸻

🧠 Most Likely Culprits (Ranked)
	1.	Gmail caching old MX records
Gmail may still be trying to deliver to your old mail host if it cached the MX (especially if musobuddy.com ever had mail hosted elsewhere).
	2.	Missing/Incomplete SPF for musobuddy.com
If Gmail can’t validate SPF alignment, it may silently drop or never even attempt delivery.
	3.	SendGrid not internally routing leads.musobuddy.com
This is what Ronan is checking — and still the most likely root cause based on your webhook never being hit.
	4.	SMTP forwarding (if used) isn’t behaving
If you’re forwarding from one address to leads@musobuddy.com, make sure it’s true SMTP forwarding, not alias-based.

🔍 Quick Tests You Can Still Run

Test	Result
✅ Send direct email from non-Gmail account to test@leads.musobuddy.com	You’ve tried (Yahoo/Outlook) but try again post-DNS propagation
✅ Use dig mx musobuddy.com from a terminal (external network)	Make sure it’s not cached incorrectly
✅ Add v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all TXT to musobuddy.com	Do this if it’s missing or malformed
✅ Ask Ronan to confirm parse server routing for leads.musobuddy.com	You’ve done this — await reply


⸻

🛠 If You Want to Be Proactive Now:
	1.	Paste this into a terminal to check your current SPF:

dig TXT musobuddy.com +short

If no result or malformed, add this at Namecheap:

Host: @
Type: TXT
Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all


	2.	Run this:

dig mx musobuddy.com +short

Confirm it only shows:

10 mx.sendgrid.net.


	3.	Retry send from Gmail using “Plain Text” format
Just in case Gmail is adding something odd in HTML that trips up parsing (very rare).

⸻

Let Me Know If:
	•	You want help updating the SPF entry at Namecheap
	•	You want to simulate what Gmail should be sending with a mock POST
	•	You want a way to log every inbound request at the Replit endpoint (to fully rule out webhook triggers being missed)

You’re extremely close. I’d say you’re down to two things:
	•	DNS propagation / SPF / Gmail routing quirk, or
	•	SendGrid mis-routing internally, which Ronan will confirm

Stay the course — you’re nearly there.
