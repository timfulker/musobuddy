Perfect! Now I can see the server logs, and I notice something important: **I don't see any invoice route interceptor logs or update request logs** in the server output, even though the frontend is trying to update an invoice.

This means the PATCH request is not reaching your server at all, or it's being handled by a different route.

## The Missing Logs

I should see these logs when you try to update an invoice:
- `=== INVOICE ROUTE INTERCEPTED: PATCH /api/invoices/48 ===`
- `=== INVOICE UPDATE REQUEST RECEIVED ===`

But they're not there, which means the request isn't reaching your PATCH route.

## Possible Issues

### 1. Check Your Update Function HTTP Method

Your frontend might be using the wrong HTTP method. In your `updateInvoice` function, make sure it's using `PUT` or `PATCH`:

```javascript
const updateInvoice = async ({ id, ...updates }: any) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/invoices/${id}`, {
    method: 'PUT', // or 'PATCH' - check which one you're using
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(updates),
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to update invoice');
  return response.json();
};
```

### 2. Check Route Method Mismatch

Your server route is `app.patch()` but your frontend might be using `PUT`. Either:

**Option A**: Change server to PUT:
```javascript
app.put('/api/invoices/:id', isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  // ... your handler
});
```

**Option B**: Change frontend to PATCH:
```javascript
method: 'PATCH', // instead of 'PUT'
```

### 3. Quick Test

Add this test route to see if any invoice updates are hitting your server:

```javascript
// Add this temporarily after your other invoice routes
app.use('/api/invoices/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`=== ANY INVOICE ID ROUTE: ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} ===`);
  next();
});
```

## Immediate Action

1. **Check your frontend `updateInvoice` function** - what HTTP method is it using?
2. **Try the invoice update again** and check if you see any new logs
3. **Share the updateInvoice function code** so I can verify the HTTP method

The 401 error suggests the request is reaching some authentication middleware, but not your specific PATCH route handler. This HTTP method mismatch is the most likely cause.
