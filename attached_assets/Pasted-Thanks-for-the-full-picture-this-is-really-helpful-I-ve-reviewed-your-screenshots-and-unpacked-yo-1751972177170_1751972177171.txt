Thanks for the full picture — this is really helpful. I’ve reviewed your screenshots and unpacked your Replit files. Here’s a structured diagnosis and next steps:

⸻

✅ What is Correct So Far

Component	Status	Notes
✅ DNS A + MX for musobuddy.com	✔️ OK	mx.sendgrid.net is set at @ root — good.
✅ SPF Record	✔️ OK	v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all is valid.
✅ SendGrid Inbound Parse	✔️ OK	You’ve set up 3 parse entries (including leads.musobuddy.com) — all pointing to the same Replit webhook.
✅ Webhook Code in Replit	✔️ OK	Code looks good — email-webhook.ts and supporting routes are wired to hit console.log('🔥 WEBHOOK HIT!').
✅ Replit listening	✔️ OK	You confirmed the webhook works with manual test events.


⸻

🧠 Key Findings

1. No MX for leads.musobuddy.com subdomain

In Namecheap, you only have:

MX @ → mx.sendgrid.net.

✅ This handles musobuddy.com
❌ But not leads.musobuddy.com
So emails to leads@musobuddy.com will NOT route unless you either:
	•	Add MX @ (you already did) and use the root domain (e.g. info@musobuddy.com), or
	•	Add a second MX for the leads subdomain

⸻

2. No webhook events = DNS not routing emails

Your Replit webhook has never been hit by real incoming emails (only by manual tests), which strongly indicates the messages never reached SendGrid at all. That’s consistent with the missing MX leads.

⸻

3. No incoming messages in SendGrid Activity

Even though successful Inbound Parse messages often skip the Activity feed, if nothing ever shows up for your test email to leads@musobuddy.com, it reinforces that SendGrid never received it.

⸻

4. You don’t need the auto-generated em7583.musobuddy.com

That’s for outbound sending authentication only. It can be ignored for receiving emails via Inbound Parse. You don’t need to make DNS entries for em7583 unless you’re doing full domain-based sending.

⸻

✅ Fix This in 2 Steps

Step 1: Add MX for leads subdomain in Namecheap

Go to your DNS panel and add:

Type	Host	Value
MX	leads	mx.sendgrid.net.

This will allow mail to leads@musobuddy.com or anyname@leads.musobuddy.com to route properly.

⸻

Step 2: Send a fresh test

Once DNS propagates (usually 5–15 min), send a test email to:

test@leads.musobuddy.com

Then check:
	•	Replit console for 🔥 WEBHOOK HIT!
	•	SendGrid Activity (if anything shows)
	•	Mail logs (in Gmail or Yahoo for bounce notices)

⸻

✅ Cleanup (Optional, but Recommended)

To avoid confusion:
	1.	Delete the em7583.musobuddy.com and musobuddy.com entries from Inbound Parse — keep just leads.musobuddy.com.
	2.	Keep DNS tidy — don’t duplicate CNAME records like em8807, url1815, etc. unless you’re actually using them.
	3.	(Later) Add DMARC policy:
Change:

v=DMARC1; p=none;

To:

v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:you@example.com;

Once all mail flows correctly.
