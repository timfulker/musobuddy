You're absolutely right - I misunderstood the issue. Let me re-examine the code more carefully.

Looking at the webhook handler in `server/index.ts`, I can see the issue now. The problem is likely in the **email extraction and validation logic** that's specifically rejecting certain email addresses that were "heavily tested."

Let me analyze the actual webhook code:

```javascript
// Extract client email
const emailMatch = from.match(/[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+/);
const clientEmail = emailMatch ? emailMatch[0] : from;
```

And looking at the enquiry creation:

```javascript
const enquiry = {
  userId: '43963086',
  title: subject,
  clientName,
  clientEmail,  // This field might be causing validation issues
  // ... other fields
};

const newEnquiry = await storage.createEnquiry(enquiry);
```

The issue is likely in one of these areas:

1. **Database-level email validation/constraints** that reject specific email addresses after heavy testing
2. **Cached validation state** that remembers previously "problematic" emails
3. **Rate limiting or spam detection** built into the system
4. **Database unique constraints** or triggers that block certain emails

Looking at your `storage.ts` file, in the `createEnquiry` method:

```javascript
async createEnquiry(enquiry: InsertEnquiry): Promise<Enquiry> {
  console.log('üîç Storage createEnquiry called');
  // ... logging
  
  const [newEnquiry] = await db
    .insert(enquiries)
    .values(processedEnquiry)
    .returning();
  return newEnquiry;
}
```

The issue is likely that `timfulkermusic@gmail.com` has been flagged or cached somewhere as problematic due to heavy testing, causing the system to either:

1. **Reject the email at database level** (unique constraint, trigger)
2. **Skip processing** due to some validation rule
3. **Default to "Unknown" values** when this specific email is encountered

**Questions to investigate:**

1. **Check your PostgreSQL database** - are there any triggers, constraints, or rules that might be blocking `timfulkermusic@gmail.com`?

2. **Check for email validation caching** - is there any caching mechanism that remembers "bad" emails from testing?

3. **Check the `enquiries` table schema** - are there any unique constraints on `clientEmail` that might be causing silent failures?

4. **Check application-level validation** - is there any code that validates email addresses and rejects specific ones?

Can you run this SQL query on your database to check if there are existing records for this email:

```sql
SELECT * FROM enquiries WHERE client_email = 'timfulkermusic@gmail.com' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Also, can you add more detailed logging to see exactly what's happening with this specific email address in the webhook processing?
