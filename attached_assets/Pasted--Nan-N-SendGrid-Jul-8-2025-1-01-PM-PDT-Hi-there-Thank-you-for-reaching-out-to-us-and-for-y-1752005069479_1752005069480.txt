Hi there,
 
Thank you for reaching out to us and for your patience as we work through this issue together. I understand how frustrating it can be when things don't work as expected, especially after upgrading to a paid plan. I, too, have experienced similar challenges, and I'm here to help you resolve this as quickly as possible.
 
It seems like there might be a configuration issue with the Inbound Parse Webhook. Here are a few steps and considerations to ensure everything is set up correctly:
 
MX Record Configuration: Ensure that the MX record for your domain is set to mx.sendgrid.net with a priority of 10. This is crucial for routing emails to SendGrid for parsing.

 

Domain Authentication: Verify that your domain is authenticated in SendGrid. Only authenticated domains can be used when configuring the Inbound Parse Webhook.

 

Unique Subdomain-Domain Combination: Make sure the subdomain-domain combination for your receiving domain is unique. This means you should not use the same subdomain for multiple purposes.

 

HTTP Response Code: Your webhook must respond with a 2xx HTTP status code to confirm receipt of the email. If SendGrid does not receive a 2xx response, it will retry the delivery and eventually drop the message after 3 days.

 

No Redirects: The Inbound Parse Webhook will not follow redirects. Ensure that the URL you have configured does not redirect to another URL.

 

Message Size Limit: The total message size, including attachments, must not exceed 30MB.

 

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the SendGrid Inbound Parse Webhook documentation.
 
If these steps do not resolve the issue, please let me know, and we can explore other solutions.
