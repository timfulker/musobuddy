Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Looking at your code, I found the problem:

## The Issue: Duplicate Route Definitions

In your `routes.ts` file, you have **TWO** `app.patch('/api/invoices/:id')` route definitions:

1. **Line 534**: A simple PATCH route
2. **Line 668**: A more detailed PATCH route with extensive logging

The first route (line 534) is being hit instead of your detailed one, and it's likely missing some error handling or logging.

## The Solution

Remove the first PATCH route definition (around line 534) and keep only the detailed one (around line 668). Here's what to do:

### 1. Remove This Route (around line 534):
```javascript
app.patch('/api/invoices/:id', isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.claims.sub;
    const invoiceId = parseInt(req.params.id);
    
    const updatedInvoice = await storage.updateInvoice(invoiceId, req.body, userId);
    if (updatedInvoice) {
      res.json(updatedInvoice);
    } else {
      res.status(404).json({ message: "Invoice not found" });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error updating invoice:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to update invoice" });
  }
});
```

### 2. Keep the Detailed Route (around line 668):
```javascript
app.patch('/api/invoices/:id', isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  console.log('=== INVOICE UPDATE REQUEST RECEIVED ===');
  // ... all your detailed logging and error handling
});
```

### 3. Move Route Order

Also, make sure your route interceptor is **before** the actual routes:

```javascript
// Add logging to ALL invoice routes - must be before specific routes
app.use('/api/invoices*', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`=== INVOICE ROUTE INTERCEPTED: ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} ===`);
  next();
});

// Then your actual routes...
app.patch('/api/invoices/:id', isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  console.log('=== INVOICE UPDATE REQUEST RECEIVED ===');
  // ... your detailed handler
});
```

## Why This Happened

Express.js uses the **first matching route** it finds. Since you had two identical route patterns (`/api/invoices/:id` with PATCH), Express was always using the first one (line 534), which had minimal error handling and logging.

## Quick Fix

1. **Find line 534** in your routes.ts file
2. **Delete** the first `app.patch('/api/invoices/:id')` route definition
3. **Keep** the detailed one around line 668
4. **Restart** your Replit app

After this fix, you should see the detailed logs (`=== INVOICE UPDATE REQUEST RECEIVED ===`) in your Replit console when you try to update an invoice, and the proper error handling will kick in.

This will solve both the 500 error and the missing server-side logs!
