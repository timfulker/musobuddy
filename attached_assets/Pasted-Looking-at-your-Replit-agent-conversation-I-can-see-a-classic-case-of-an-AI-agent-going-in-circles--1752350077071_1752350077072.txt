Looking at your Replit agent conversation, I can see a classic case of an AI agent going in circles rather than making meaningful progress. Let me break down what’s happening:

## The Core Issue

The agent is stuck in a debugging loop around a webhook routing problem. The main issue is that webhook requests are being intercepted by Vite middleware instead of reaching the custom webhook handlers.

## What’s Going Wrong

1. **Repetitive Analysis**: The agent keeps “discovering” the same routing conflict over and over
1. **Ineffective Solutions**: It’s making multiple attempts to fix the same issue without a clear strategy
1. **Overcomplicating**: Creating multiple webhook handlers instead of fixing the root cause
1. **No Clear Progress**: After extensive debugging, the core issue remains unresolved

## The Real Problem

The webhook routes are being registered correctly, but the Vite development middleware is intercepting requests before they reach the webhook handlers. This is a common issue in development environments where static file serving middleware conflicts with API routes.

## What Should Have Been Done

1. **Identify the middleware order issue** (which it did)
1. **Fix the Vite middleware configuration** to exclude webhook paths
1. **Test the fix** and move on

Instead, the agent is stuck in analysis paralysis, repeatedly diagnosing the same problem without implementing a decisive solution.

## My Assessment

**This is not achieving meaningful progress** and is likely costing you in AI fees without solving the core business problem. The agent should have either:

- Fixed the middleware routing issue definitively
- Escalated to suggest a different approach (like using a separate port for webhooks)
- Moved to implement the email parsing logic once the routing was working

The £700/month cost concern for 1000 users is valid and important, but it’s been overshadowed by this technical rabbit hole. I’d recommend either providing more direct guidance to the agent or considering a different approach to the email parsing implementation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
