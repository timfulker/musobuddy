That’s a great direction for Phase 2 or 3. A “Social Media Buddy” could become a major differentiator for MusoBuddy, helping musicians with marketing without needing to become full-time content creators. Here’s a list of feature ideas you could implement, grouped by purpose:

⸻

🔄 Smart Content Automation

Purpose: Reduce the effort required to stay active on socials
	•	Auto-Generated Post Templates
Generate templated posts for:
	•	Upcoming gigs (“Catch me live this Friday in Brighton!”)
	•	Behind-the-scenes content
	•	Rehearsals, travel, new gear, etc.
	•	AI-Created Social Captions
Input a few keywords (e.g. “wedding, sax, Dorset”) and get a caption with hashtags and emojis.
	•	Gig Wrap-Up Post Generator
After an event, generate a “Thank you [venue/client]!” style post including:
	•	Audience photo (if uploaded)
	•	Testimonial snippet
	•	Short gig highlight summary (generated from notes/logs)

⸻

📸 Media and Testimonial Management

Purpose: Centralise and re-use good content and praise
	•	Photo & Video Upload Library
Let users upload post-worthy media from gigs, band rehearsals, or events, with optional captions and tags.
	•	Client Testimonial Capture Tool
Simple link to send to clients after a gig. Prompts them to rate the performance and leave a short testimonial. AI can polish the quote for sharing.
	•	“Best of” Content Curator
Automatically identifies most engaging past posts or testimonials and suggests reposting them on slow weeks.

⸻

📅 Scheduled Social Posting

Purpose: Keep up appearances without daily effort
	•	Weekly or Monthly Post Planner
User selects what type of posts they want each week (e.g. 1 gig promo, 1 throwback, 1 client review). System auto-generates and schedules them.
	•	Social Media Calendar View
Visual overview of what’s being posted and when.
	•	Auto-Crossposting
One-click push to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, and Threads (via APIs or integrations with tools like Buffer/Later/Zapier).

⸻

🧠 Smart Suggestions & Engagement Boosters

Purpose: Increase reach and interaction
	•	Post Timing Optimiser
Suggests best times to post based on user’s past engagement or general audience behavior.
	•	Trending Hashtag Assistant
Recommends relevant hashtags for each post based on gig type, genre, or location.
	•	Auto Comment & DM Reply Templates
Canned but customizable replies to common gig inquiries or fan comments.

⸻

📊 Analytics Dashboard

Purpose: Help users see what’s working
	•	Engagement insights per post (likes, comments, shares)
	•	Testimonial usage tracker (which quotes are being used)
	•	Growth over time (followers, audience engagement, reach)

⸻

🤝 “Buddy Boost” Social Exchange (Optional/Experimental)

Purpose: Network musicians and boost each other’s posts
	•	Create a small internal network of musicians who agree to like, comment, or share each other’s posts.
	•	Could be opt-in only, possibly gamified (e.g. earn tokens to boost your own post by boosting others).
