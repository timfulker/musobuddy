I can see the issue now! Looking at your current files, I notice a few problems:

1. **Database Schema Issue**: You added `customInstruments` field to the schema, but you might need a database migration
2. **Form Logic Issue**: The form is handling both `instrumentsPlayed` and `customInstruments` separately, but they should work together
3. **Backend Logging**: The backend logs show it's receiving the data, but we need to verify what's actually being saved

Let me create a comprehensive fix:## Action Plan to Fix This:

### 1. **Check Database Schema**
First, let's verify the database has the `custom_instruments` column:

```sql
-- Connect to your database and run:
\d user_settings;
-- Look for 'custom_instruments' column
```

If it's missing, run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_instruments TEXT;
```

### 2. **Apply the Code Changes**
Apply all the updates from the artifact above to your files.

### 3. **Test with Debug Output**
After applying the changes:

1. **Add a custom instrument** (e.g., "Bagpipes")
2. **Click "Debug Form State"** button 
3. **Click "Save Settings"**
4. **Check console logs** for all the `ðŸ”¥` messages

### 4. **Expected Debug Output**
You should see this sequence:

```
ðŸš€ FORM SUBMIT: Starting submission
ðŸš€ FORM SUBMIT: instrumentsPlayed: ["saxophone","bagpipes"]
ðŸš€ FORM SUBMIT: customInstruments: ["bagpipes"]
ðŸ”¥ ROUTES: instrumentsPlayed in request: ["saxophone","bagpipes"]
ðŸ”¥ ROUTES: customInstruments in request: ["bagpipes"]
ðŸ”¥ STORAGE: instrumentsPlayed in result: ["saxophone","bagpipes"]
ðŸ”¥ STORAGE: customInstruments in result: ["bagpipes"]
```

### 5. **Database Verification**
After saving, check the database directly:

```sql
SELECT instruments_played, custom_instruments 
FROM user_settings 
WHERE user_id = '43963086';
```

**The Root Cause**: Most likely the `custom_instruments` column doesn't exist in your database yet, so the data is being silently ignored during the database update.

Try the database column check first, then apply the code changes. Let me know what you find!
