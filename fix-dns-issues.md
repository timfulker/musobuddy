# Fix DNS Issues for Email Forwarding

## Issue 1: TXT Record showing "Active" instead of "Verified"

The TXT record for `mailo._domainkey.musobuddy.com` is showing "Active" instead of "Verified". This could be causing email authentication issues.

**Action needed:**
1. Go to your Namecheap DNS management
2. Find the TXT record for `mailo._domainkey.musobuddy.com`
3. Verify the value exactly matches what Mailgun shows:
   ```
   k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDb+9X7LeYD7bPMPBtWV9hOI69...
   ```
4. If it doesn't match exactly, update it
5. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Issue 2: DMARC Record Not Configured

Gmail and Yahoo now require DMARC records. This is critical for email delivery.

**Action needed:**
1. Go to your Namecheap DNS management
2. Add a new TXT record:
   - **Host:** `_dmarc.musobuddy.com`
   - **Value:** `v=DMARC1; p=none; pct=100; fo=1; ri=3600; rua=mailto:dcd00fb8@dmarc.mailgun.org`
3. Save the record
4. Wait 1-2 hours for DNS propagation

## Why This Matters

- **Active vs Verified:** The "Active" status suggests the DNS record might not be properly recognized
- **DMARC:** Without this, Gmail and Yahoo may reject or heavily filter your emails
- **Email Authentication:** Both issues can prevent emails from being delivered to your webhook

## Next Steps

1. Fix both DNS records
2. Wait for DNS propagation (1-2 hours for DMARC, up to 24 hours for the TXT record)
3. Test email forwarding again

This should resolve the email delivery issues you're experiencing.
