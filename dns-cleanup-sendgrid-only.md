# DNS Cleanup - SendGrid Only Solution

## Problem Identified
Your DNS has mixed SendGrid/Mailgun records causing routing conflicts:
- **MX Records**: Currently point to Mailgun (mxa.mailgun.org, mxb.mailgun.org)  
- **DKIM/CNAME**: Point to SendGrid (working for outbound emails)
- **Multiple webhooks**: Both SendGrid and Mailgun handlers active

## Solution: Clean SendGrid-Only Setup

### Step 1: Update MX Record in Namecheap
**Change from:**
```
Type: MX, Host: @, Value: mxa.mailgun.org, Priority: 10
Type: MX, Host: @, Value: mxb.mailgun.org, Priority: 10
```

**To:**
```
Type: MX, Host: @, Value: mx.sendgrid.net, Priority: 10
```

### Step 2: Update SendGrid Inbound Parse
In your SendGrid dashboard:
1. Go to Settings > Inbound Parse
2. Add hostname: `musobuddy.com`
3. Set webhook URL: `https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/sendgrid`

### Step 3: Clean SPF Record
**Update TXT record to:**
```
v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
```
(Remove any mailgun.org references)

## Current Status
✅ SendGrid outbound emails working (contracts/invoices)  
✅ SendGrid webhook code functional  
✅ Mailgun webhook removed to eliminate conflicts  
✅ DNS records will point to single service

## Why This Will Work
- **No service conflicts**: Only SendGrid handling emails
- **Proven outbound**: Your contract/invoice emails work perfectly
- **Clean webhook routing**: Only one email service hitting webhook
- **Consistent authentication**: All DKIM/SPF/DMARC aligned

This eliminates the routing confusion that was preventing external emails from reaching your webhook.
