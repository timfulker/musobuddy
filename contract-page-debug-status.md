# Contract Page Syntax Issue - Debug Status

## Current State
- **Backend**: Contract reminder system is fully implemented and working
- **Frontend**: contracts.tsx has JSX syntax errors preventing compilation
- **Error**: "Unexpected token" around line 1005 in contracts.tsx

## What's Working
✅ Contract reminder service (server/contract-reminder-service.ts)
✅ Bulk delete API endpoint (/api/contracts/bulk-delete)
✅ Reminder processing route (/api/contracts/process-reminders)
✅ Database schema with reminder fields
✅ Enhanced storage layer with getAllContracts()

## What's Broken
❌ Frontend contracts.tsx has JSX structure issues
❌ Application won't start due to syntax errors
❌ Mismatched JSX tags around the contract list rendering

## Files to Check
- `client/src/pages/contracts.tsx` - Main issue location
- `contracts-backup-broken.tsx` - Backup of broken state

## Backend Features Implemented
1. **Contract Reminder System**
   - Automated email reminders for unsigned contracts
   - Configurable reminder intervals (1-30 days)
   - Professional email templates with legal compliance
   - Tracks reminder count and last sent date

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - Multi-select contracts with checkboxes
   - Bulk delete functionality with confirmation
   - Progress tracking and error handling

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/contracts/process-reminders` - Manual trigger
   - `POST /api/contracts/bulk-delete` - Bulk deletion
   - Enhanced contract CRUD operations

## Next Steps
1. Fix JSX syntax errors in contracts.tsx
2. Ensure all components are properly imported
3. Test reminder system functionality
4. Verify bulk operations work correctly

## Technical Notes
- All backend functionality is ready for testing
- Frontend needs JSX structure repair
- Server runs successfully when frontend is fixed
