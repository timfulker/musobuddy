# End of Day Summary - October 8, 2025

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Support Email System Fix
- **Issue**: Support email endpoint was causing 401 errors and logging users out
- **Root Cause**: Endpoint was looking for `req.user?.uid` instead of `req.user?.id`
- **Fix**: Changed to `req.user?.id` in `server/routes/support-chat-routes.ts:221`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Support emails now send successfully

### 2. Support Email Frontend Response Parsing
- **Issue**: Frontend was checking `response.success` on raw Response object instead of parsed JSON
- **Fix**: Added `const data = await response.json()` before checking `data.success`
- **File**: `client/src/components/support-chat.tsx:219`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - No more error messages in UI

### 3. SendGrid Migration - Missing `db` Import
- **Issue**: Support webhook failing with "db is not defined" error
- **Fix**: Added `import { db } from './core/database'` to `server/index.ts:9`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (requires rebuild/restart to take effect)

### 4. Settings Page UI - Delete Account Modal Width
- **Issue**: Delete account confirmation modal content was wider than background
- **Fix**: Changed modal width from `sm:max-w-md` to `sm:max-w-xl`
- **File**: `client/src/pages/Settings.tsx:4250`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 5. Settings Page UI - Export Button Alignment
- **Issue**: Export button overlapping with panels below on smaller screens
- **Fix**: Changed flex layout to stack vertically on mobile, horizontally on desktop
- **File**: `client/src/pages/Settings.tsx:2982`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 6. Account Deletion - GDPR Compliance
- **Issue**: Delete account only deleted database records, not Supabase Auth user
- **Critical**: This was a data compliance violation
- **Fix**: Added Supabase Admin API call to delete auth user
- **File**: `server/routes/settings-routes.ts:2160-2192`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Now fully GDPR compliant

### 7. User Display Name - Supabase Auth Metadata
- **Issue**: timfulkermusic@gmail.com had no display name showing in app
- **Fix**: Updated Supabase Auth metadata with SQL:
  ```sql
  UPDATE auth.users
  SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"display_name": "Tim Fulker"}'::jsonb
  WHERE email = 'timfulkermusic@gmail.com';
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 8. Payment Terms Default Values Bug
- **Issue**: When booking created with default payment terms (not customized), `paymentTerms` and `dueDate` were NULL, causing invoices to default to "7 days from today"
- **Root Cause**: Booking form didn't populate these fields when using defaults from settings
- **Fix**:
  - Added logic to fetch user settings and calculate payment terms/due date on booking creation
  - Created `calculateDueDateFromPaymentTerms()` helper function
  - Auto-populates `paymentTerms`, `dueDate`, and `paymentTermsCustomized` fields
- **Files**:
  - `server/routes/booking-routes.ts:23-45` (helper function)
  - `server/routes/booking-routes.ts:242-260` (booking creation logic)
  - `server/routes/booking-routes.ts:320-322` (added fields to bookingData)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (requires rebuild/restart to take effect)

### 9. Feedback System - Missing Database Column
- **Issue**: Beta tester feedback submissions failing with "column attachments does not exist"
- **Fix**: Created migration to add `attachments` column
- **Migration**: `server/migrations/add-attachments-to-feedback.sql`
- **SQL Run**: ✅ Applied to production database
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 10. Feedback Attachments - File Serving
- **Issue**: Feedback attachments uploaded but PDFs failed to load (404 error)
- **Root Cause**: Files stored in filesystem but no route to serve them
- **Fix**: Added authenticated route to serve feedback attachments
- **File**: `server/routes/feedback-routes.ts:63-111`
- **Security**: Only beta testers and admins can access attachments
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (requires rebuild/restart to take effect)

## 🔄 Changes Requiring Server Restart

The following changes have been made to the code but require a server rebuild/restart to take effect:

1. **`server/index.ts`** - Added `db` import for webhook logging
2. **`server/routes/booking-routes.ts`** - Payment terms default calculation logic
3. **`server/routes/feedback-routes.ts`** - Feedback attachment serving route

**Action Required**: Rebuild and restart the server when convenient

---

## 📊 Database Migrations Applied Today

1. **`add-attachments-to-feedback.sql`** - Added attachments column to feedback table
   - Status: ✅ Applied to production

---

## 🚀 All Systems Status

- ✅ Support Emails: Working
- ✅ Account Deletion: GDPR Compliant
- ✅ Feedback System: Working with attachments
- ✅ Booking Creation: Fixed payment terms defaults

## 📝 Pending Work / Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Test Payment Terms Fix**: After server restart, create a new booking with default payment terms and verify invoice due date is calculated correctly

2. **Test Feedback Attachments**: After server restart, verify beta testers can upload and admins can view attachments

### Medium Priority
3. **SendGrid Migration Completion**:
   - Configure SendGrid Inbound Parse for support@musobuddy.com
   - Add MX record in Namechoap for support@musobuddy.com
   - Monitor migration for 30 days
   - After 30 days: Delete Mailgun routes and cancel subscription

### Low Priority
4. **Consider Adding User Profile Settings**: Allow users to update their own display name, firstName, lastName in the UI instead of requiring database updates

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Notes

- Account deletion now properly removes users from both database AND Supabase Auth
- Feedback attachment access restricted to beta testers and admins only
- All authentication endpoints using correct Supabase token validation
