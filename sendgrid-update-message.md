# Update for SendGrid Support

Hi Ronan,

Quick update on the DNS investigation:

## DNS Records Status: ✅ ALL CONFIRMED ACTIVE

We initially thought some DNS records had disappeared from our Namecheap control panel, but this was a false alarm - all records are present and working correctly:

- **MX Record**: musobuddy.com → mx.sendgrid.net (priority 10) ✅
- **SPF Record**: "v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all" ✅  
- **CNAME Records**: All SendGrid authentication records active ✅
- **Propagation**: All records responding correctly via DNS lookup ✅

## Current Status

This confirms that the email forwarding issue is definitely on the SendGrid side, not DNS configuration. Our technical setup is completely correct:

1. **DNS Routing**: Emails to leads@musobuddy.com should reach mx.sendgrid.net
2. **Webhook Endpoint**: https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/sendgrid responding with 200 OK
3. **Email Processing**: Ready to create enquiries immediately when emails arrive

## What We're Still Seeing

- Zero webhook calls from SendGrid despite multiple test emails
- No entries in SendGrid Activity log for inbound emails
- Emails sent to leads@musobuddy.com are not reaching our webhook

## Ready for Your Investigation

The comprehensive technical package we provided earlier (`sendgrid-support-package.md`) contains all the evidence you need. Our system is fully operational and ready to process emails the moment SendGrid's internal routing is resolved.

Please let us know what your internal investigation finds regarding email reception and subdomain routing.

Thanks for your continued support!

Best regards,
Tim
