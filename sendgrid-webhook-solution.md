# SendGrid Inbound Parse Webhook Solution

## Issue Summary
Based on SendGrid support response from July 8, 2025, the Inbound Parse webhook is not functioning. SendGrid provided specific requirements that need to be validated and potentially fixed.

## SendGrid Requirements Checklist

### 1. MX Record Configuration ✅
- **Requirement**: MX record must point to `mx.sendgrid.net` with priority 10
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - `10 mx.sendgrid.net.` is correctly configured
- **Command**: `curl -s "https://dns.google/resolve?name=musobuddy.com&type=MX"`

### 2. Domain Authentication ⚠️
- **Requirement**: Domain must be authenticated in SendGrid dashboard
- **Status**: ⚠️ TO VERIFY - Need to check SendGrid dashboard
- **Action**: Verify in SendGrid console that musobuddy.com is authenticated

### 3. Unique Subdomain-Domain Combination ✅
- **Requirement**: `leads@musobuddy.com` must be unique
- **Status**: ✅ CONFIRMED - This is a dedicated email for enquiries only

### 4. HTTP Response Code ⚠️
- **Requirement**: Webhook must respond with 2xx status
- **Status**: ⚠️ TO TEST - Current webhook may have timeout issues
- **Current endpoints**:
  - `https://musobuddy.com/api/webhook/sendgrid` (primary)
  - `https://musobuddy.com/api/webhook/email` (alternative)
  - `https://musobuddy.com/api/webhook/sendgrid-alt` (fallback)

### 5. No Redirects ✅
- **Requirement**: Webhook URL must not redirect
- **Status**: ✅ CONFIRMED - Direct endpoint, no redirects

### 6. Message Size Limit ✅
- **Requirement**: Total message size must not exceed 30MB
- **Status**: ✅ CONFIRMED - Email enquiries typically under 1MB

## Current Technical Issues

### Webhook Timeout Problem
The webhook endpoint appears to be timing out during testing, which would cause SendGrid to receive non-2xx responses.

### Multiple Webhook Endpoints
The system has multiple webhook endpoints configured, which may cause confusion. We should consolidate to one primary endpoint.

## Recommended Solution

### 1. Simplify Webhook Configuration
- Use single endpoint: `https://musobuddy.com/api/webhook/sendgrid`
- Ensure it returns 2xx status within 30 seconds
- Add comprehensive error handling

### 2. Test Webhook Accessibility
- Verify webhook responds to POST requests
- Test with SendGrid's expected form data format
- Ensure no timeouts or 5xx errors

### 3. SendGrid Dashboard Configuration
- Verify domain authentication status
- Configure Inbound Parse webhook with correct URL
- Test with actual email to `leads@musobuddy.com`

### 4. Monitoring and Debugging
- Add detailed logging to webhook endpoint
- Monitor SendGrid webhook logs
- Test email delivery end-to-end

## Implementation Status
- ✅ MX Record configured correctly
- ✅ Multiple webhook endpoints available
- ⚠️ Webhook timeout issues need resolution
- ⚠️ Domain authentication needs verification in SendGrid dashboard
- ⚠️ Inbound Parse webhook needs configuration in SendGrid

## Next Steps
1. Fix webhook timeout issues
2. Verify domain authentication in SendGrid dashboard
3. Configure Inbound Parse webhook in SendGrid
4. Test with actual email delivery
5. Monitor logs for successful processing
