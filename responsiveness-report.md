## Key Responsive Patterns Found

### Consistent Padding
- Most pages use `p-4` or `px-4` for mobile padding
- Container classes like `max-w-md`, `max-w-2xl`, `max-w-4xl` prevent content from stretching too wide

### Responsive Grids
- Grid layouts use responsive modifiers: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Flex layouts with `flex-col lg:flex-row` for responsive direction changes

### Mobile-Specific Features
- `use-mobile` hook for device detection
- Mobile-specific navigation components
- Dedicated mobile pages for better UX

### Overflow Handling
- Tables have horizontal scroll containers
- Long content uses `overflow-hidden` or `overflow-auto`
- Text truncation with `truncate` or `line-clamp` utilities
