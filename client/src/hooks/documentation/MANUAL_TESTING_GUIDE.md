```

## Database Verification

### Check User Creation
```sql
SELECT id, email, phone_number, phone_verified, tier, created_at 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```

### Check Phone Verification
```sql
SELECT phone_number, verification_code, verified_at 
FROM phone_verifications 
WHERE phone_number = '+447123456789' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Check Sessions
```sql
SELECT sess->'user'->>'id' as user_id, 
       sess->'user'->>'email' as email,
       expire 
FROM sessions 
WHERE expire > NOW();
```

## Production Testing Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All manual tests pass
- [ ] API test script shows 7/7 passed
- [ ] Database shows clean test data
- [ ] Console logs show proper environment detection
- [ ] SMS integration configured for production

### After Deployment
- [ ] Landing page loads on production URL
- [ ] Signup creates real users
- [ ] SMS verification works with real phone numbers
- [ ] Session persistence works across browser restarts
- [ ] Error handling shows user-friendly messages

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Verification code not working"
**Solution:** Check console logs in development mode for the actual code

### Issue: "SMS not sending"
**Solution:** Verify Twilio credentials and add phone number to verified list in trial mode

### Issue: "Session not persisting"  
**Solution:** Check PostgreSQL connection and sessions table

### Issue: "Environment detection wrong"
**Solution:** Check REPLIT_ENVIRONMENT and NODE_ENV variables

### Issue: "Phone number format error"
**Solution:** Use UK format (07xxxxxxxx) - system auto-converts to +44

## Cleanup After Testing

### Remove Test Users
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%test%' OR email LIKE '%example.com';
DELETE FROM phone_verifications WHERE phone_number = '+447123456789';
DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expire < NOW();
```

### Reset for Production
```sql
-- Keep only admin account
DELETE FROM users WHERE email != 'timfulker@gmail.com';
DELETE FROM phone_verifications;
DELETE FROM sessions;
```
