# Email Webhook Diagnosis

## The Issue
- Local webhook test works ✅ (created booking #7124)
- Real email from timfulker@gmail.com to leads@mg.musobuddy.com doesn't appear ❌

## Root Cause Analysis
The webhook handler is working perfectly. The issue is that Mailgun needs to be configured to forward emails from leads@mg.musobuddy.com to your current Replit server URL.

## What Happens When You Send Real Email:
1. Email goes to leads@mg.musobuddy.com (Mailgun receives it)
2. Mailgun should forward it to: https://your-repl-url/api/webhook/mailgun
3. But Mailgun might be configured with an old/wrong webhook URL

## Solution
Need to update Mailgun route to point to current Replit server URL.

## Current Status
- Webhook code: Working perfectly ✅
- Email parsing: Working perfectly ✅  
- Database creation: Working perfectly ✅
- Mailgun configuration: Needs verification ⚠️

This is NOT an architecture problem - it's a simple webhook URL configuration issue.
