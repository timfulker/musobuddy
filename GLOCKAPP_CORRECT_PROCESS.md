# GlockApps Testing - Correct Process

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: GlockApps tests must be initiated from their dashboard FIRST!

The emails were delivered successfully, but GlockApps won't show results because the test wasn't started from their side first.

## Correct Process:

### Step 1: Start Test in GlockApps Dashboard
1. Log into GlockApps: https://glockapps.com/spam-testing/
2. Click "Create New Test" 
3. Select "Manual Test" option
4. Copy the Test ID they provide (format: usually something like `GL-XXXXX-XXXXX`)

### Step 2: Run the Test Script with GlockApps Test ID
```bash
npx tsx send-glockapp-test.ts GL-XXXXX-XXXXX
```

### Step 3: Check Results
- Results appear in GlockApps dashboard within 5-10 minutes
- Dashboard will show inbox placement, spam scores, authentication results

## What Went Wrong:
- We sent emails with our own test ID (`glockapp-small-1754939078029`)
- GlockApps only tracks tests initiated from their dashboard
- The emails were delivered (confirmed via Mailgun logs) but GlockApps ignores unknown test IDs

## Delivery Status from Our Test:
✅ elizabeaver@auth.glockdb.com - Delivered
✅ juliarspivey@aol.com - Delivered (after retry due to rate limit)
✅ davidvcampbell@aol.com - Delivered (after retry due to rate limit)
✅ lynettedweyand@protonmail.com - Delivered
✅ bbarretthenryhe@gmail.com - Delivered

## Note on Yahoo/AOL Rate Limiting:
- Initial sends to AOL addresses were rate limited (error 421)
- Mailgun automatically retried after 10 minutes and succeeded
- This is why Yahoo/AOL requires slower sending rates
