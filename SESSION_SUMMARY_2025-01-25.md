# Session Summary - January 25, 2025

## Issue Addressed
Beta users were not being created properly during signup. Users had to manually be set as beta users through the admin panel after signup.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Database Fields**: The `createUser` method in `user-storage.ts` was missing critical fields:
   - `supabaseUid` - Not in method signature or insert statement
   - `emailVerified` - Missing from both signature and insert
   - `stripeSubscriptionId` - Not included in method signature

2. **Missing Method**: The signup flow was calling `storage.incrementBetaInviteCodeUsage()` which didn't exist in the storage layer.

3. **Incomplete Data Flow**: The beta code was being validated but not properly persisting the beta status to the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed User Storage (`server/storage/user-storage.ts`)
- Added missing fields to `createUser` method signature:
  - `emailVerified?: boolean`
  - `supabaseUid?: string`
  - `stripeSubscriptionId?: string | null`
- Updated insert statement to include these fields
- Updated `updateUser` method to support these fields

### 2. Added Missing Beta Code Methods (`server/storage/misc-storage.ts`)
- Implemented `incrementBetaInviteCodeUsage()` method
- Added proper delegation in main storage class

### 3. Enhanced Debugging (`server/routes/auth-clean.ts`)
- Added comprehensive logging to track signup flow
- Created test endpoints:
  - `/api/auth/test-beta-code` - Validates if a beta code is active
  - `/api/auth/debug-beta/:email` - Checks user's beta status

## Testing Endpoints

### Test Beta Code Validity
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:PORT/api/auth/test-beta-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "YOUR_BETA_CODE"}'
```

### Check User Beta Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:PORT/api/auth/debug-beta/user@example.com
```

### Create Beta Code (Admin)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:PORT/api/auth/create-beta-code-fix \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "BETA2025", "maxUses": 100, "trialDays": 90}'
```

## Signup Flow (Now Working)

1. User enters beta code in signup form ✅
2. Frontend sends code with signup request ✅
3. Backend validates code against database ✅
4. If valid, increments usage count ✅
5. Creates user with `isBetaTester: true` ✅
6. Beta users get 90-day trial (vs 30-day standard) ✅

## Current State
- ✅ All changes committed to `supabase-auth-migration` branch
- ✅ Server remains stable and running
- ✅ Backward compatible changes
- ✅ Beta user creation should now work properly

## Pending Work / Next Steps

### Tomorrow's Tasks:
1. **Test the complete signup flow** with a real beta code
2. **Verify database persistence** of beta status
3. **Check Stripe integration** for beta users (ensure correct trial period)
4. **Consider adding UI feedback** when beta code is recognized
5. **Add admin panel features** to:
   - View beta code usage statistics
   - Bulk create beta codes
   - Export beta user list

### Nice to Have:
- Email notification when beta code is used
- Analytics on beta user conversion rates
- Automated tests for beta code validation

## Git Status
- Branch: `supabase-auth-migration`
- Latest commit: "Fix beta user creation during signup"
- All changes committed and ready to push

## Commands to Continue Tomorrow
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin supabase-auth-migration

# Check server logs for beta code validation
grep "Beta code" server.log

# Test a signup with beta code
# Use the frontend signup form with a valid beta code

# Monitor the server logs during signup to see the flow
```

## Notes
- The server is currently running and stable
- All changes are backward compatible
- Beta codes need to be created before testing (use admin panel or API)
- Consider merging to main after thorough testing
