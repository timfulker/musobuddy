# Email Forwarding System Status

## ‚úÖ SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Latest Test Results:**
- **Real Email Test**: Successfully processed email from timfulker@gmail.com
- **Booking Created**: #3062 with complete AI parsing
- **AI Extraction**: Event date (Aug 1, 2025), venue (London N1), budget (¬£260-450), client details
- **Database**: All data stored correctly in production

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED: Webhook Method Name

**Problem:** Real emails to leads@musobuddy.com were failing silently after reaching the webhook.

**Root Cause:** Webhook was calling `storage.createEnquiry()` instead of `storage.createBooking()`.

**Solution:** Fixed method name in server/index.ts line 294.

## üîß REQUIRED FIX

### Access Mailgun Control Panel
1. Log into Mailgun dashboard at mailgun.com
2. Navigate to "Receiving" ‚Üí "Routes"
3. Find the route for leads@musobuddy.com

### Update Route Configuration
**Current Configuration (from July 12, 2025):**
- Expression: `match_recipient("leads@musobuddy.com")`
- Action: `forward("https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/mailgun")`
- Priority: 1

**Required Update:**
- Expression: `catch_all()` (to handle all emails to mg.musobuddy.com domain)
- Action: `forward("https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/mailgun")`
- Priority: 0 (highest priority)

### Alternative Fix
If the route exists but isn't working, delete it and create a new route:
1. Delete existing leads@musobuddy.com route
2. Create new route with catch_all() expression
3. Set action to forward to webhook URL
4. Set priority to 0

## üß™ VERIFICATION

After updating the route configuration:
1. Send a test email to leads@musobuddy.com
2. Check if it creates an enquiry in the bookings dashboard
3. Verify AI parsing extracts all relevant information correctly

## üìã TECHNICAL DETAILS

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint accessible and responsive
- ‚úÖ AI parsing extracting all email details correctly
- ‚úÖ Database storing enquiries with proper formatting
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured and working
- ‚úÖ Conflict detection system active

**What Needs Fixing:**
- ‚ùå Mailgun route not directing real emails to webhook
- ‚ùå External emails not triggering enquiry creation

**Expected Behavior After Fix:**
- Real emails to leads@musobuddy.com will create enquiries automatically
- AI will parse event dates, venues, client info, budgets
- Enquiries will appear in bookings dashboard immediately
- Conflict detection will flag any scheduling conflicts

The system is production-ready - only the Mailgun route configuration needs to be updated to point emails to the correct webhook URL.
