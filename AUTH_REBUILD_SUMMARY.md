# Authentication System Rebuild - Progress Summary

## Problem
Google OAuth sign-up was stuck in a loop, redirecting users back to create user page instead of Stripe payment. Multiple competing authentication systems were causing conflicts.

## What We Did Tonight
1. **Identified Root Causes:**
   - Multiple competing auth hooks (useAuth, useFirebaseAuth, useSubscriptionWatchdog, useBulletproofAuth)
   - Client-side bypass logic treating `pending_payment` users as having valid subscriptions
   - Server watchdog returning `hasValidSubscription: true` for `pending_payment` users
   - Existing user in database had `isAdmin: true` blocking redirects

2. **Clean Rebuild Approach:**
   - Backed up old auth files (.backup extensions)
   - Created single clean `useAuth.tsx` hook
   - Fixed server `/api/auth/firebase-login` endpoint
   - Removed all competing authentication systems

## New Authentication Flow
```
User signs up with Google OR Email/Password
‚Üì
Firebase authentication
‚Üì
Call /api/auth/firebase-login
‚Üì
Server checks: tier === 'pending_payment' && !isAdmin && !stripeCustomerId
‚Üì
If needs payment: Return paymentRequired: true
‚Üì
Client immediately redirects to Stripe checkout
‚Üì
NO dashboard, NO wizard - direct to payment
```

## Files Modified
- `client/src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - New clean auth hook
- `server/routes/auth-clean.ts` - Fixed payment detection logic
- Backed up: `useAuth.tsx.backup`, `useFirebaseAuth.tsx.backup`, `useSubscriptionWatchdog.tsx.backup`

## Next Steps for Tomorrow
1. Test Google sign-up in fresh incognito window
2. Should redirect directly to Stripe checkout (no dashboard/wizard)
3. If still issues, debug the new clean system (much simpler than before)

## Key Server Endpoints
- `/api/auth/firebase-login` - Main authentication endpoint
- `/api/stripe/create-checkout` - Stripe payment redirect

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Clean auth system implemented
- ‚úÖ Payment redirect logic fixed
- üîÑ Ready for testing
- ‚ùå Not yet tested

## Context for Tomorrow's Claude
"We spent 4+ hours debugging broken Google OAuth authentication. The user should go directly from Google sign-up to Stripe checkout, but was getting stuck in dashboard with wizards. We rebuilt the entire auth system - now need to test if the clean approach works."
