# DNS Fix Instructions - Switch to SendGrid Only

## Problem Identified
Your DNS has mixed SendGrid/Mailgun records causing email routing conflicts:
- MX Records: Point to Mailgun (mxa.mailgun.org, mxb.mailgun.org)
- DKIM Keys: Point to SendGrid (s1.domainkey.u53986634.wl135.sendgrid.net)
- SPF Record: Includes both services

## Solution: Complete SendGrid Configuration

### Step 1: Update MX Record in Namecheap
**Change MX record from:**
```
10 mxa.mailgun.org
10 mxb.mailgun.org
```

**To:**
```
10 mx.sendgrid.net
```

### Step 2: Update SPF Record
**Change TXT record from:**
```
v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net include:mailgun.org ~all
```

**To:**
```
v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

### Step 3: Update Webhook URL in SendGrid
In your SendGrid dashboard, update the Inbound Parse webhook URL to:
```
https://musobuddy.replit.app/api/webhook/sendgrid
```

### Current DNS Records to Keep
- A Record: 76.76.19.19 ✅
- DMARC Record: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:tim@musobuddy.com; ruf=mailto:tim@musobuddy.com; fo=1; adkim=s; aspf=s ✅
- DKIM Records: s1._domainkey and s2._domainkey → SendGrid ✅
- All SendGrid CNAME records ✅

## Why This Will Work
1. **Consistent Service**: All email routing through SendGrid
2. **Working Outbound**: Your contract/invoice emails already work via SendGrid
3. **Clean DNS**: No conflicting records between services
4. **Proper Authentication**: DKIM, SPF, and DMARC all aligned with SendGrid

## After DNS Changes
- Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- Test by sending email to leads@musobuddy.com
- Check webhook logs for proper email data parsing
