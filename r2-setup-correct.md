# Correct Cloudflare R2 Setup Instructions

## Issue Identified
The current setup is using the same API token for both Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which is incorrect.

## Correct R2 Configuration Steps

### 1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to R2 Object Storage
### 2. Click "Manage R2 API tokens"
### 3. Create a new R2 Token (not Workers token)
   - Token type: "R2 Token" (not "Workers R2 Storage")
   - Permissions: Object Read & Write
   - TTL: No expiry (or set as needed)

### 4. After creating the token, you'll get TWO different values:
   - **Access Key ID** (shorter, like: abc123def456...)
   - **Secret Access Key** (longer, like: xyz789abc123def456...)

### 5. Use these values in the cloud storage configuration:
```typescript
credentials: {
  accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',      // First value from R2 token
  secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', // Second value from R2 token
}
```

## Current Problem
We're using the same Workers API token for both fields:
```typescript
accessKeyId: 'Hkmu_3Tbqq2DYHLo24b8oMAoV2vHbLcGTOOFHq',
secretAccessKey: 'Hkmu_3Tbqq2DYHLo24b8oMAoV2vHbLcGTOOFHq', // Same value - WRONG
```

## Next Steps
1. Create proper R2 Token (not Workers token)
2. Get separate Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
3. Update the configuration with correct values
4. Test the integration

Would you like to proceed with creating the correct R2 token, or would you prefer to abandon the cloud storage approach entirely?
