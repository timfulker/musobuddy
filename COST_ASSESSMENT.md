# MusoBuddy Cost Assessment

## What Actually Works (FREE to verify)
- ✅ Email webhook creates bookings (tested)
- ✅ Basic server runs without crashing
- ✅ Authentication system functional
- ✅ Frontend pages load

## What's Broken (EXPENSIVE to fix)
- 68 TypeScript errors in storage layer
- Duplicate function implementations
- Schema mismatches
- 27 conflicting server files

## Cost Analysis
- Fix current mess: $15-25 (2-3 hours)
- Start fresh with clean architecture: $0 (your time)
- Partial fix (just make it work): $5-8 (30 minutes)

## Recommendation
The core functionality (email → booking) works. The rest is architectural mess that's expensive to untangle.

Your choice:
1. Pay $25 to fix properly
2. Pay $5 for minimal working version  
3. Start fresh elsewhere (free)
