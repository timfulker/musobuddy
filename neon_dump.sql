The client may have been unresponsive because they cancelled their event, decided that they don’t need musicians, or booked elsewhere.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nAt Encore we do our best to make sure that once you’ve set your job alert settings you only hear about the most relevant jobs. So you don’t ever need to worry about wasting your time presenting your skills to clients whose enquiries are inappropriate for your act.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\t\t\r\nThe Encore Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t  Stay SafeBy taking work through Encore, you protect yourself from fraud and remain covered by Encore deposits and the Encore cancellation policy. Please report any clients requesting to pay outside of Encore, as this is against our terms and may signal a fraudulent offer.\r\n\r\nGot a question?

This takes ~10 seconds per Package. Here’s how to do it:\r\n1. Go to your Profile (https://encoremusicians.com/dashboard) → Price guides → Packages\r\n2. Click Edit\r\n3. Select a Performance duration and confirm with Update\r\n\r\nUpdate my Packages (https://encoremusicians.com/dashboard)\r\nIf you haven’t added any Packages or Add-ons yet, now’s the perfect time to do so!\r\n\r\nThese let you showcase tailored packages for different line-ups, event types, or any extras you can provide - for example, full-day wedding packages, weekday pub gigs, holiday specials, a “with PA” vs. “without PA” option, PA hire, or additional music.\r\n\r\nThe more tailored your offerings, the more likely a client will spot the perfect fit for their event.\r\n\r\nHere’s how you can list your Packages and Add-ons:\r\n1. Go to your Profile (https://encoremusicians.com/dashboard) → Price guides → Packages → Add package → Create\r\n2. Go to your Profile (https://encoremusicians.com/dashboard) → Price guides → Add-ons → Create add-on → Create\r\n\r\nAdd Packages & Add-ons (https://encoremusicians.com/dashboard)\r\nTo increase your chances of booking gigs, we recommend taking a moment to review your Price Guides too, to ensure the pricing information on your profile is accurate and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nPro tip: when you complete your Price Guides, your profile will also receive a boost in search rankings!\r\n\r\nReview my Price Guides (https://encoremusicians.com/dashboard)\r\nPlease note: on Encore, adding prices does not mean you are committing to charging those exact rates when a customer gets in touch, as things such as travel costs or equipment requirements may impact your pricing for each event. That’s why you always provide a tailored quote for every customer. But keeping your prices up to date and as close as possible to a real quote can go a long way towards securing more bookings!\r\nIf you need any help updating your existing Packages, adding new ones, or reviewing your Price Guides, or if you have any feedback you want to share with us, just reply to this email or message us at help@encoremusicians.com (mailto:help@encoremusicians.com) and our team will be more than happy to help.\r\nHappy gigging,\r\n\r\nGiulio\r\nEncore\r\nhe/him/his\r\nhelp@encoremusicians.com (mailto:help@encoremusicians.com)\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2025 Encore, All rights reserved.\r\n You're receiving this email because you have an account with Encore.\r\n\r\nOur mailing address is:\r\nEncore\r\n1015 Limited\r\n275 New North Road\r\nLondon, London N1 7AA\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\r\nYou can ** update your preferences (https://encoremusicians.us15.list-manage.com/profile?u=5979bcf8d123ead997aaf441b&id=49fd9cd1b2&e=343aae7929&c=f882d2f560)\r\nor ** unsubscribe from this list (https://encoremusicians.us15.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=5979bcf8d123ead997aaf441b&id=49fd9cd1b2&t=b&e=343aae7929&c=f882d2f560)\r\n.\r\n Email Marketing Powered by Mailchimp\r\nhttps://login.mailchimp.com/signup/email-referral/?aid=5979bcf8d123ead997aaf441b	\N	Queue failed: Email rejected - no user configured for prefix "tim <timfulkermusic".
