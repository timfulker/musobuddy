# DNS Records Backup for musobuddy.com
**Date**: July 8, 2025  
**Issue**: DNS records disappeared from Namecheap  
**Status**: URGENT - Records need to be restored immediately  

## CRITICAL RECORDS MISSING FROM NAMECHEAP

### MX Record (MISSING - CRITICAL)
```
Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mx.sendgrid.net
Priority: 10
TTL: Automatic
```
**Status**: ❌ MISSING - This is why email forwarding stopped working

### SPF Record (MISSING - CRITICAL) 
```
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
TTL: Automatic
```
**Status**: ❌ MISSING - Required for email authentication

### SendGrid CNAME Records (PARTIALLY MISSING)
Based on our previous working configuration, these should exist:

```
Type: CNAME
Host: em8021
Value: u43963086.wl100.sendgrid.net
TTL: Automatic

Type: CNAME
Host: s1._domainkey
Value: s1.domainkey.u43963086.wl100.sendgrid.net
TTL: Automatic

Type: CNAME
Host: s2._domainkey  
Value: s2.domainkey.u43963086.wl100.sendgrid.net
TTL: Automatic

Type: CNAME
Host: url7583
Value: sendgrid.net
TTL: Automatic

Type: CNAME
Host: 43963086
Value: sendgrid.net
TTL: Automatic
```

## CURRENT RECORDS VISIBLE IN NAMECHEAP
From the screenshot, only these remain:
- A Record: @ → 76.76.19.19
- CNAME: 53986634 → sendgrid.net
- CNAME: em7583 → u53986634.wl135.sendgrid.net  
- CNAME: em8021 → u53986634.wl135.sendgrid.net
- CNAME: s1._domainkey → s1.domainkey.u53986634.wl135.sendgrid.net

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Restore MX Record (URGENT)
```
Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mx.sendgrid.net
Priority: 10
```

### 2. Restore SPF Record (URGENT)
```
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

### 3. Verify SendGrid CNAME Records
The CNAME records appear to have changed from u43963086.wl100 to u53986634.wl135
This suggests SendGrid may have updated the configuration.

## QUESTIONS FOR NAMECHEAP SUPPORT

1. **Why did the MX and TXT records disappear?**
2. **Were the records deleted automatically or manually?**
3. **Are there any logs showing when the records were removed?**
4. **Can they restore the records from backup?**
5. **Are there any account-level issues affecting DNS management?**

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Add back the MX and SPF records
2. **Verify**: Check if SendGrid CNAME records need updating
3. **Test**: Verify DNS propagation after restoration
4. **Monitor**: Watch for any additional record disappearances

## IMPACT

- ❌ Email forwarding completely broken (no MX record)
- ❌ Email authentication failing (no SPF record)  
- ❌ SendGrid integration partially broken
- ❌ leads@musobuddy.com not receiving emails

**This explains why SendGrid support couldn't find the routing - the MX record is missing!**
