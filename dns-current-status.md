## ❌ CRITICAL MISSING: MX Record

**The MX record is not visible in the screenshot!**

This is the most important record for email forwarding:
```
Type: MX
Host: @
Value: mx.sendgrid.net
Priority: 10
```

## Why This Matters

- **Without MX Record**: Emails to leads@musobuddy.com won't be routed to SendGrid
- **DNS Test Shows MX Working**: Our earlier test found the MX record, suggesting it might be:
  - In a different section of Namecheap
  - Cached but not in the control panel
  - In the "Mail Settings" section instead of "Host Records"

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Mail Settings Section**: Look for MX records in a separate "Mail Settings" or "Email" section
2. **Verify MX Record Exists**: If not found, add it immediately
3. **Test Email Routing**: Send test email to verify MX routing works

## For SendGrid Support

The missing MX record in the control panel explains the email forwarding issue. Even though DNS caching might make it appear to work temporarily, the authoritative record needs to be properly configured.

**Status**: Need to verify MX record exists and is properly configured in Namecheap.
