If the user doesn't specify a model, always prefer using "claude-sonnet-4-20250514" as it is the latest model. However, if the user has already selected "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", keep that selection unless they explicitly request a change.

  const prompt = `Extract client information from this Musicians Union contract. Tim Fulker is the musician - extract the HIRER/CLIENT details who is booking him.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Tim Fulker is the MUSICIAN - DO NOT extract his address or details as the client
- Client address: Extract ONLY the address that appears after the client name and before "and Tim Fulker"
- If client address appears to be placeholder text like "hirer's address" or is blank, return "address not supplied"
- NEVER use Tim Fulker's address (59, Gloucester Road, Bournemouth) as the client address
- Venue name and venue address are separate fields
- Convert times like "8pm" to "20:00" format
- HOME ADDRESS VENUES: If venue field contains "Home Address" or similar, set venue to "Client's Home" and use the client's address as the venue address

Contract text:
${contractText}

Return only JSON:
{"clientName":"","clientEmail":"","clientPhone":"","clientAddress":"","venue":"","venueAddress":"","eventDate":"YYYY-MM-DD","eventTime":"HH:MM","eventEndTime":"HH:MM","fee":0,"confidence":95}`;
