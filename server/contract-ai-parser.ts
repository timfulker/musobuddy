  const prompt = `Extract client information from this Musicians Union contract. Tim Fulker is the musician - extract the HIRER/CLIENT details who is booking him.

CRITICAL PARSING RULES:
- IGNORE template placeholders like "between", "of", "and", "on" - these are NOT the actual names
- Look for ACTUAL NAMES: The client name appears after "between" and before "and Tim Fulker"
- VENUE EXTRACTION: Look for "Engagement(s) at" followed by the venue name and address
- CLIENT ADDRESS: Extract the address that appears after the client name (not venue address)
- Tim Fulker is the MUSICIAN - DO NOT extract his information as the client
- NEVER use Tim Fulker's address (59, Gloucester Road, Bournemouth) as the client address
- Convert times like "1545" to "15:45" and "1900" to "19:00" format
- HOME ADDRESS VENUES: If venue field contains "Home" or is the same as client address, set venue to "Client's Home"

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
"between [CLIENT NAME] of [CLIENT ADDRESS] and Tim Fulker"
"Engagement(s) at [VENUE NAME] [VENUE ADDRESS]"

Contract text:
${contractText}

EXTRACTION PATTERNS:
- Client name: Look for text after "between" and before "of" (e.g., "between Robin Jarman")
- Client address: Look for text after client name following "of" (e.g., "of The Drift, Hall Lane...")
- Venue: Look for text after "Engagement(s) at" (e.g., "at The Drift")
- Email: Look for "Email" followed by email address
- Phone: Look for "Phone Number" followed by number
- Times: Convert military time (1545 = 15:45, 1900 = 19:00)

Return only JSON:
{"clientName":"","clientEmail":"","clientPhone":"","clientAddress":"","venue":"","venueAddress":"","eventDate":"YYYY-MM-DD","eventTime":"HH:MM","eventEndTime":"HH:MM","fee":0,"confidence":95}`;
