# Clean Email System Rebuild - Mailgun Only

## What We're Removing
1. All SendGrid imports and dependencies
2. Mixed email webhook handlers
3. Conflicting DNS configurations
4. Complex email routing logic

## What We're Building (Clean)
1. **Single Service**: Mailgun for both sending and receiving
2. **Simple Webhook**: One endpoint for email forwarding
3. **Unified Sending**: All emails (invoices, contracts) via Mailgun
4. **Clean DNS**: Only Mailgun MX records

## Implementation Steps
1. Remove all SendGrid code
2. Create clean Mailgun sender
3. Update all email routes to use Mailgun
4. Create single webhook endpoint
5. Update DNS to Mailgun only

## Time Savings
