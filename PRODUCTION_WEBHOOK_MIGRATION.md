# Production Webhook Migration Guide

## Overview
During testing, we discovered that the Stripe webhook was configured with an outdated API version (2014-08-20) that prevented proper event delivery. This guide documents the fix applied to the test environment and the steps needed for production deployment.

## Root Cause
- Webhook endpoint was accessible and correctly configured in Stripe dashboard
- API version was set to 2014-08-20 (over 10 years old)
- Modern Stripe events were not being delivered due to API version mismatch
- No webhook events reached our server despite successful payments

## Test Environment Fix Applied
```javascript
// Script used to fix test environment
1. Deleted old webhook: we_1RovNID9Bo26CG1DUdQVzyes (API version: 2014-08-20)
2. Created new webhook: we_1Rp1zCD9Bo26CG1DZqJIDupF (API version: 2023-10-16)
3. Updated webhook secret: whsec_UG2YTKBYCHpYv5AQvHMJTNrmi3fXayh6
```

## Production Migration Steps
When deploying to live Stripe environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Delete Old Webhook (if exists)
```bash
# In Stripe Live Dashboard:
# Developers ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Find old webhook ‚Üí Delete
```

### 2. Create New Webhook
**Webhook URL**: `https://musobuddy.com/api/stripe-webhook` (or production domain)

**Events to Enable**:
- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_failed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`

**API Version**: `2023-10-16` (current)

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Copy the webhook signing secret from Stripe dashboard and update:
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in production environment

### 4. Switch to Live Keys
Ensure production is using:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (live key, not test)
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (live key, not test)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (new webhook secret)

## Verification Steps
1. Complete a live subscription in production
2. Monitor server logs for webhook messages:
   - `üîç Received webhook request from Stripe`
   - `üîç Webhook signature present: true`
   - `‚úÖ Webhook processed successfully`
3. Verify subscription status updates automatically in database
4. Confirm user sees active subscription (no demo mode)

## Technical Details
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed webhook logging for production monitoring
- **Event Coverage**: Expanded events to cover full subscription lifecycle
- **API Compatibility**: Modern API version ensures compatibility with current Stripe features
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and debugging capabilities

## Fallback Plan
If webhook issues persist in production:
1. Check Stripe webhook delivery attempts in dashboard
2. Verify webhook endpoint accessibility from external networks
3. Confirm webhook secret matches between Stripe and application
4. Review server logs for detailed error messages
5. Temporarily activate subscription status manually while debugging

## Test Results
- ‚úÖ Old webhook deleted successfully
- ‚úÖ New webhook created with modern API version
- ‚úÖ Webhook secret updated in test environment
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging active and working
- ‚è≥ Awaiting test of automatic subscription activation

This migration resolves the webhook delivery issue that prevented automatic subscription status updates in the test environment.
